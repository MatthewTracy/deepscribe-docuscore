    "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, can you tell me what brought you in today?\nPatient: Yeah, I came in because I've been having a headache, feeling really tired, and I've got a fever too.\nDoctor: I see. When did these symptoms start?\nPatient: They started around midnight, back in June 2014.\nDoctor: Hmm, and did you experience any other symptoms after that?\nPatient: Yes, about 150 minutes later, I developed some meningitis symptoms like nausea, drowsiness, confusion, a stiff neck, and a positive Kernig sign.\nDoctor: That sounds concerning. What kind of treatment did you receive initially?\nPatient: I was given 1000 mg of Amoxicillin, 1000 mg of Paracetamol, and an IV dose of Ringer's lactate solution.\nDoctor: Okay, and were you transferred to another medical facility after that?\nPatient: Yes, by 9:30 A.M. I was transferred to the emergency department of Military Hospital 108 because I started showing symptoms of blood sepsis.\nDoctor: I see. So you were diagnosed with meningitis and sepsis, correct?\nPatient: That's right.\nDoctor: And how were you treated for these conditions?\nPatient: They treated me with ceftriaxone at a dose of 1 g, four times a day.\nDoctor: Good. I understand that your cerebrospinal fluid was collected and a N. meningitidis culture was grown. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yeah, the culture they grew was designated as DuyDNT, and it was identified to belong to serogroup B.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that you recovered successfully after treatment. Now, on the topic of the DuyDNT isolate, it has been revealed to be a novel sequence type. It was assigned an ST 13074 by PubMLST, a public database that catalogs genetic data and isolate provenance of the Neisseria genus. Did you know that?\nPatient: No, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: By sequencing the seven housekeeping genes used in the MLST scheme, every N. meningitidis isolate can be assigned a sequence type (ST) and placed into groups and clonal complexes based on evolutionary relatedness. Besides DuyDNT, only two other isolates of ST 13074 have been found, both were carrier strains identified in Vietnam in 2017. ST 13074 shared \u2265 5 identical alleles at seven typed loci with three other STs (1576, 11013, and 13455), making it the central ST of this group by PubMLST group's definition.\nPatient: Oh, I see. That's interesting.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. Now, moving forward, it's essential that you continue monitoring your health and reporting any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider. Keep up with any required follow-up appointments, and take care of yourself.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my health and follow your advice.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient reports experiencing headaches, fatigue, fever, nausea, drowsiness, confusion, a stiff neck, and a positive Kernig sign since midnight, June 2014. Symptoms escalated to include signs of meningitis and later, blood sepsis. The patient was initially treated with Amoxicillin, Paracetamol, and Ringer's lactate solution, followed by a transfer to a specialized facility for further management.\nO: Upon admission to Military Hospital 108, the patient was diagnosed with meningitis and sepsis and treated with 1 g of ceftriaxone four times daily.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I understand you are a 19-year-old boy with a normal body mass index and normal blood pressure. You've lived in Tehran city and have been experiencing some health issues. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been having?\nPatient: Yeah, since March 2017, I've suffered from periodic febrile attacks with temperatures between 39-40\u00b0C. During these fever attacks, I've had many aphthous ulcers in my mouth, swollen glands in my neck, and a sore in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: I see. How long do these fever periods typically last, and how often do they occur?\nPatient: The fever periods usually last about 7 days. After the disease goes down, the next attack comes around 45 days later. I also feel weakness, severe fatigue in my limbs, and a slight abdominal pain in the LUQ area during the time of the attacks.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. I understand you were first admitted to the hospital in July 2017 during a severe fever attack due to weakness, lethargy, and high temperature. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The doctors noticed my high fever of 39.8\u00b0C, severe aphthous mouth ulcers, inflammation in my throat, and swollen lymph nodes on my neck during the physical examination.\nDoctor: During that time, they also examined your abdomen and found splenomegaly. After these examinations, they requested some laboratory tests to determine the cause of the disease. Do you remember what tests were done?\nPatient: Yes, they did a bunch of tests, like urine culture, blood culture, stool exam, stool culture, HIV antibody, hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, peripheral blood smear, malaria, borrelia, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide.\nDoctor: I see. The results of all these tests were negative except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 31. Did they perform an abdominal ultrasound examination to determine the size of your spleen?\nPatient: Yes, they did. The ultrasound examination determined that my spleen was larger than normal, measuring 32 \u00d7 140.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing all of this information. We will continue to monitor your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment. It's important that you follow up with us regularly to track any changes in your symptoms or health.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for your help, doctor. I'll make sure to schedule regular appointments to keep you updated.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient is a 19-year-old male from Tehran with a history of periodic febrile attacks since March 2017, presenting with high fevers (39-40\u00b0C), aphthous ulcers, swollen glands in the neck, and a sore throat. These episodes typically last about 7 days and recur approximately every 45 days. The patient also experiences weakness, severe fatigue, and slight abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) during these attacks. He was first hospitalized in July 2017 during a severe episode.\nO: Physical examination during past hospitalization revealed high fever (39.8\u00b0C), severe aphthous mouth ulcers, throat inflammation, swollen lymph nodes, and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including urine and blood cultures, stool exam and culture, tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, rheumatoid factor, peripheral blood smear, malaria, borrelia, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 31. An abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged spleen measuring 32 \u00d7 140 mm.\nA: The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a periodic fever syndrome, possibly Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) or another autoinflammatory disorder, given the negative infectious and autoimmune workup and the presence of splenomegaly and elevated ESR. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of periodic fever or lymphoproliferative disorders.\nP: The management plan will include regular monitoring and follow-up appointments to track symptom progression and response to any treatments initiated. Further evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in autoinflammatory diseases is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy, possibly including colchicine or other anti-inflammatory medications. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease, potential complications, and importance of compliance with follow-up visits is crucial."

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you were diagnosed with bronchial asthma at 10 years of age and treated with inhalants. Have you received any treatment for asthma since then?\nPatient: No, I stopped receiving treatment for asthma when I was 30 because of the resolution of bronchial asthma.\nDoctor: I understand. You've been followed at our hospital for idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with annual regular chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans for 4 years. Have you experienced any symptoms related to this?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any symptoms, and the findings have been stable over the years.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We did a Chest X-ray and CT scan in December 2017, and it revealed a high-attenuation mucus plug in your right intermediate bronchial trunk, right pleural effusion (Fig. a), and infiltration in the right lung field (Fig. b). Additionally, we found unilateral bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: We also did a CT of your paranasal sinuses due to your nasal congestion for 3 years, and it revealed a high-attenuation mucus plug in the left ethmoid sinuses. During your physical examination, we noticed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field. No wheezing and rhonchi were observed on auscultation.\nPatient: Hmm, yes, I've had nasal congestion for a while now.\nDoctor: Blood tests showed a total leucocyte count of 9300/mm3 with 8% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 744/mm3) and elevated C-reactive protein. The radioimmunosorbent test revealed elevated IgE levels (1460 IU/ml). The radioimmunosorbent test for specific IgE antibodies against Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Candida were positive, as were serum precipitins to Aspergillus.\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean?\nDoctor: We also confirmed local urticaria and lash 15 minutes after a subcutaneous injection of A. fumigatus antigen, which is positive for an immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. You also have a history of right nephrectomy due to renal cancer, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your pulmonary function test showed the following: forced vital capacity (FVC), 1.86 L (55.4% of predicted value); forced expiratory volume. It's important that we continue to monitor your condition and discuss appropriate treatment options if necessary.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I see that you have a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, hypertension, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and obesity. Can you tell me how you're feeling today?\nPatient: Well, I was doing some yard work earlier, and I suddenly had trouble seeing out of my right eye and had difficulty remembering names and events.\nDoctor: I see. Let's discuss some of your previous test results to better understand your situation. Last year, during a preoperative evaluation for dental work, a 12-lead electrocardiogram found incidental PVCs. Holter monitoring showed a 12% PVC burden over 24 hours, which indicates an indeterminate degree of ventricular dysfunction. Do you remember these tests?\nPatient: Yes, I remember going through those tests.\nDoctor: Following those tests, we performed a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed hypokinesis of the left inferior ventricular wall with an ejection fraction of 35%. Cardiac catheterization was also done to investigate structural blockages of coronary vessels, but it yielded no significant CAD. These findings were suspicious for an infiltrative process. Can you recall that?\nPatient: Yeah, I remember the doctors mentioning something about that.\nDoctor: We then conducted a cardiac MRI which showed sarcoid infiltrates on T2-weighted images, and a pulmonary node biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis three months after your initial presentation. At that time, you showed no clinical symptoms of systemic sarcoidosis or heart failure. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed for primary prevention of arrhythmias secondary to cardiac sarcoid. Have you been feeling well since then?\nPatient: Yes, I've been doing well for the past year until these recent stroke-like symptoms started.\nDoctor: During your examination today, your speech and language seemed normal. I asked you to write a simple sentence, which you did without difficulty. However, when asked to read the sentence, you were unable to do so. This represents alexia without agraphia. Additionally, you showed right homonymous hemianopia. The rest of your physical exam was normal. \nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: At admission, we performed an initial computed tomography (CT) scan which came back negative. We will conduct a subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further investigate the cause of your symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I do next?\nDoctor: We'll closely monitor your symptoms and follow up with the MRI results. In the meantime, please report any changes in your condition or any new symptoms that may arise. We'll work together to determine the best course of action for your situation.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our center with complaints of painless jaundice. Before we begin, do you have any family history of cancer?\nPatient: No, I don't have any family history of cancer.\nDoctor: Alright. What about your medical history? Are there any significant conditions you've been treated for?\nPatient: Yes, I had pulmonary tuberculosis in the past and I was treated with medications for that.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. When you were admitted, we performed a physical examination and found moderately icteric sclera and jaundice. The circulatory, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. We also conducted some laboratory tests. The results showed elevated total bilirubin of 403 \u03bcmol/L, aspartate aminotransaminase of 153 U/L, alanine aminophosphatase of 93 U/L, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 10.2 ng/mL, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) of 1073.6 U/mL. \nPatient: Hmm, I see. What do those numbers mean?\nDoctor: These numbers indicate that you have high levels of bilirubin and certain enzymes, as well as elevated tumor markers, which could suggest a possible malignancy. We also performed a pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan, which was negative except for a few areas of fibrosis resulting from your previous tuberculosis infection. Additionally, we conducted a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which showed severe stenosis at the junction of the left and right common hepatic ducts and marked dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What about my abdomen?\nDoctor: An abdominal enhanced CT scan revealed a 2-cm mass in the hepatic hilum and regional lymph node enlargement. To relieve cholestasis and improve your liver function, we performed a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis?\nDoctor: Based on all these findings, we made a tentative diagnosis of Bismuth IV type pCCA. You underwent surgical resection, which included a left hemihepatectomy, cholecystectomy, and lymphadenectomy. The reconstruction was achieved by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\nPatient: Was the procedure successful?\nDoctor: Yes, the procedure was considered curative since intraoperative frozen examination showed that the resection margin was free of atypical cells. Within the resected specimen, we found a yellowish tumor measuring 2 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm \u00d7 1 cm in the hilar bile duct. Microscopically, the tumor showed a nested organoid growth pattern.\nPatient: What does that mean for my recovery?\nDoctor: It means that the surgery was successful in removing the tumor and we believe that the cancer has been treated. However, it is important to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and ensure that there are no signs of recurrence.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and I'll make sure to schedule those follow-up appointments.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and best wishes for your recovery.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented here today with a history of bilateral nasal obstruction. Can you tell me about that?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had this problem for about 10 years. I actually had septoplasty and functional endoscopic sinus surgery 7 years ago at another hospital, but I didn't see much improvement in my symptoms.\nDoctor: I see, so you still experience nasal obstruction. Can you tell me more about any other symptoms you've had since then?\nPatient: Well, I've had this right nasolabial fold fullness for a year now, and it has increased in size over time. I also have right facial pain.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information. During your clinical examination, we found a swelling in your right nasolabial fold, measuring 2x1 cm. It was tender to palpation and hard in consistency, but the skin over it appears normal. We also performed an anterior rhinoscopic examination of your right nasal cavity and found a lateral nasal wall swelling that is obliterating about 90% of your nasal vestibule. The mucosa and skin color externally appear normal.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: To further investigate the issue, we performed computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The images revealed a well-defined subcutaneous soft tissue density measuring 1.6x1.6 cm in your right nasolabial fold. The lesion demonstrated isointensity with no drop in fat saturation on T1 but showed hypointensity on T2 and homogeneous enhancement postcontrast.\nPatient: So, what did you do about it?\nDoctor: In August 2014, you underwent surgical excision of the mass through a sublabial approach. The mass was encapsulated with no infiltration to surrounding tissues, and it was excised completely with its capsule. You had an uncomplicated postoperative period.\nPatient: That's a relief. What did you find out about the mass?\nDoctor: Histopathological examination of the mass revealed spindle cell proliferation, forming fascicles and whorls on a background of collagen fibers. The fascicles were associated with foci of mixed inflammatory cells infiltrate, composed mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with scattered eosinophils and neutrophils. The lesion infiltrated the surrounding striated muscles and fatty tissue but did not infiltrate the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the lesion was affecting some of the surrounding tissues, but not the skin or the fatty tissue beneath the skin. We also performed immunohistochemical studies on the spindle cells and found that they were diffusely positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) and focally positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In contrast, they were negative for S100, CD34, P-catenin, CD99, and epithelial membrane.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and recovery. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms. We will schedule follow-up appointments to ensure that the excision was successful and that there are no further complications or recurrence of the mass.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient reports a history of bilateral nasal obstruction for 10 years, with previous septoplasty and functional endoscopic sinus surgery 7 years ago, which did not significantly improve symptoms.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I understand. Do you have any past medical history we should be aware of?\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension, and I've been treated with amlodipine besylate tablets for it.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. During your examination, we found rebound tenderness at the McBurney's point, but your bowel sounds were normal. We also conducted a laboratory examination upon admission, which showed your white blood cell (WBC) count at 20.31*10^9/L and your neutrophilic granulocyte percentage (N%) at 94.3%. These results indicate an infection. To further assess your condition, we performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.\nPatient: What did the CT scan show?\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed gas in your intra- and extra-hepatic portal and mesenteric veins, in addition to appendicitis with peripheral peritonitis. Due to these findings, we planned an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. However, I understand you rejected this option?\nPatient: Yes, I was scared and didn't want to go through surgery.\nDoctor: I understand your concerns. As an alternative, we started conservative treatment with antibiotics, specifically Piperacillin Sodium and Tazobactam Sodium for Injection. Over the following 4 days, your abdominal pain became generalized, and signs of diffused peritonitis and borborygmus gradually disappeared. Unfortunately, there were no decreases in your inflammatory markers after the antibiotic treatment.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We conducted a repeated abdominal CT scan, which showed the absence of gas in your intra- and extra-hepatic portal and superior mesenteric veins. However, the scan also revealed enhanced pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis and a dilated small intestine, which had become more severe. Additionally, the appendicitis with peripheral peritonitis was still present.\nPatient: So what's the next step?\nDoctor: Based on your abdominal signs and changes in laboratory and imaging examination results, we suspected intestinal necrosis. We performed an emergency laparotomy on the fifth day of admission to further investigate.\nPatient: What did you find during the surgery?\nDoctor: The intra-operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of a suppurated appendix, with about 20 ml of purulent secretion around it. We also observed remarkable necrosis, approximately 100 cm, in the small intestinal wall and mesentery. Furthermore, there was an intestinal perforation in the necrotic bowel.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a critical situation, but we will do our best to manage your condition and guide you through the recovery process. It's essential to follow all postoperative care instructions and attend follow-up appointments as scheduled. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.",
    "soap_note": "S: Patient presents with aggravated lower abdominal pain for the past 6 days, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

I've been having a worsening cough and chest tightness for the past 10 days.\nDoctor: I see. Have you been treated for this issue recently?\nPatient: Yes, I was treated for bronchitis with steroids and antibiotics, but my symptoms didn't improve.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your recent emergency department visit. What were your symptoms at that time?\nPatient: I had severe and sudden shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and sharp radiating pain between both shoulder blades when I took a deep breath.\nDoctor: At the time of presentation, you were afebrile and your vital signs were within normal limits. Your lab work, including negative leukocyte count and cardiac enzymes, was also insignificant. However, a chest X-ray demonstrated an abnormal right cardiomediastinal silhouette with a large opacity over the right mediastinum adjacent to the right atrial border. A follow-up CT scan revealed a large right-sided mass measuring 5.1 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 4.3 cm. Your last imaging study, a fluoroscopy 10 years ago, showed no indications for a mediastinal mass. An echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction (55\u201359%), no wall motion abnormalities, and a cyst near the right atrium. Due to your continued pleuritic chest pain and difficulty breathing, we decided to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pericardial cyst removal.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What happened during the surgery?\nDoctor: During the surgery, you underwent general anesthesia with a 37 French left-sided double-lumen tube. Standard ASA monitors were applied. Two large-bore peripheral IVs and an arterial line were placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Intraoperatively, we found a large cystic lesion adherent to the pericardium. There was no solid component and no obvious communication with the pericardium. Part of the cyst wall was left on the phrenic nerve to preserve it.\nPatient: How did I do after the procedure?\nDoctor: You tolerated the procedure well, had no postoperative complications, and were discharged home on postoperative day number two. The final pathology report revealed a benign, acute inflammatory pericardial cyst.\nPatient: That's a relief. Thank you for explaining everything, doctor.",

After that, I started experiencing central scotoma and decreased vision in both eyes.\nDoctor: I see. Are you taking any medications for any other conditions?\nPatient: Yes, I'm taking etizolam for a psychiatric condition, panic disorder.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that information. We conducted a series of tests during your first visit. Your decimal best corrected visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left eye. We also performed Slit lamp examinations, which showed no abnormalities in the anterior segments and media of both eyes. Additionally, we conducted fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography, which indicated no remarkable abnormalities in either eye.\nPatient: Okay, and what about the OCT images?\nDoctor: The OCT images showed an elevated and blurred ellipsoid zone along with loss of the interdigitation zone at the foveal area bilaterally. There was no vitreomacular adhesion or traction seen in either of the eyes.\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis, Doctor?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the findings from the tests, you have been diagnosed with solar retinopathy. This condition is likely a result of the sun gazing incident you mentioned earlier.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the treatment plan then?\nDoctor: We started treatment during your first visit. You were given a posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection in your right eye, followed by oral prednisolone therapy.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I hope this treatment will help improve my vision.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We will monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.

It's been getting worse, and now it's affecting my upper limbs too. I'm unable to walk or eat alone anymore.\nDoctor: I see. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with HIV infection five years ago at another tertiary care hospital, but I refused follow-up.\nDoctor: I understand. Given your symptoms and medical history, let's start with a neurological examination. We'll also need to run some tests to figure out what's going on.\n(After the examination and tests)\nDoctor: Your neurological examination showed lethargy, disorientation, and psychomotor slowing. Your motor strength is also asymmetrically diminished, with a Medical Research Council Scale of grade 2/5 in right upper limb extension, grade 3/5 in bilateral lower limb extension, and grade 4/5 in the remaining. Your deep tendon reflexes are symmetrical, except for absent right brachioradialis and bilateral patellar reflexes. You also have impaired pin-prick sensibility in the right ulnar and radial distribution. However, the rest of your physical examination was unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a brain MRI and an electromyography (EMG) test. The MRI is consistent with HIV encephalopathy, and the EMG shows severe confluent multifocal demyelination and axonal loss in both your upper and lower limbs. This indicates MNM as the diagnosis.\nPatient: What about my blood tests?\nDoctor: Your CD4 cell count is at 75 cells/\u03bcL (8%), and your HIV RNA is 633,000 copies/mL. Your CMV DNA in blood is 64,000 copies/mL, with CMV antigen being negative. CMV IgG antibodies are positive, and IgM antibodies are negative. Your previous medical records confirmed prior CMV IgG seropositivity, suggesting CMV reactivation.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We also analyzed your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which showed 7 cells, protein of 1.19 g/dL, and glucose of 49 mg/dL. Bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, but CMV DNA was positive at 14,400 cp/mL and HIV RNA at 184,222 cp/mL. We also found gastrointestinal involvement by disseminated CMV disease, even though you reported no related symptoms. Retinal involvement has been excluded.\nPatient: So what's the cause of my symptoms?\nDoctor: The most likely cause of your MNM is disseminated CMV disease. We're going to start you on IV ganciclovir as treatment.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for helping me figure out what's going on. I hope the treatment helps.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Can you tell me about your baby's mother's reproductive history?\nPatient's Family: Yes, she had an abnormal reproductive history. Her first baby died of convulsion at 23 days after birth, and her second pregnancy was ectopic.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I understand that this patient was referred here due to intermittent convulsions for more than 2 months and an exacerbation for 2 days. Can you describe the convulsions?\nPatient's Family: They would happen while he was awake or asleep, but he didn't have a fever. He would go back to normal without any movement disorders afterward.\nDoctor: I see. And how has his overall condition been lately?\nPatient's Family: He has presented with decreased attention, poor head control, and thumb abduction.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. We've conducted a cerebral MRI which revealed patchy hyperintensity in the bilateral frontal and parietal lobe on T2WI. We also noted widened ventricles and the interval outside the cerebral. His EEG showed sleep spindle asynchrony.\nPatient's Family: Oh no, what does that mean?\nDoctor: These findings indicate brain abnormalities that could be contributing to the convulsions. Additionally, Blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis, and GHB in his urine was significantly elevated according to the urinary organic acid analysis. \nPatient's Family: That's very concerning. What's the cause of all this?\nDoctor: We've identified a homozygous mutation variant, c.1529C > T (p.S510F), in exon 10 of the ALDH5A1 gene in the patient. Subsequent targeted mutational analysis of exon 10 of his mother confirmed the segregation of the variant. The healthy father did not carry the sequence variant. The p.S510 mutation is highly conserved, and its mutation is predicted to be \"Probably damaging.\"\nPatient's Family: Oh, that's so unfortunate. What can be done for him?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, I have some sad news. Despite our best efforts, the patient has passed away due to pneumonia. Our team tried everything we could to save him, but his condition was too severe.\nPatient's Family: We appreciate everything you have done.

Genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation, c.1529C > T (p.S510F), in exon 10 of the ALDH5A1 gene, confirmed in the mother and absent in the healthy father.\nA: The primary diagnosis was a genetic disorder related to the ALDH5A1 gene mutation, leading to severe neurological symptoms and metabolic disturbances. Differential diagnoses initially considered included other causes of neonatal seizures and metabolic disorders. The prognosis was poor due to the severe brain abnormalities and genetic findings.\nP: Management included supportive care for convulsions and metabolic acidosis, with close monitoring of neurological status and metabolic parameters. Genetic counseling was provided to the family to discuss the implications of the genetic findings. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to complications from pneumonia. Bereavement support and further genetic counseling for the family were recommended."

How long have you been experiencing this issue?\nPatient: Yeah, doctor, I've had this problem for quite a while now.\nDoctor: I understand. When you first presented to the clinic on February 8th, 2018, there was an inflammatory reaction on the plantar surface of both of your feet. We took a specimen collection from the plantar surface, and under KOH preparation, we found hyphae indicative of a fungal infection. This led to the diagnosis of a tinea pedis infection. Does that sound familiar?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: We treated your infection with ketoconazole topical cream and 20% Urea creams, which you were instructed to apply daily. When you came back for a follow-up approximately 6 weeks later, we noticed a resolution of the underlying fungal infection, with minimal remaining inflammation. \nPatient: Yeah, I noticed improvement after using those creams.\nDoctor: Given your initial presentation, we considered the possibility of an exaggerated immune reaction caused by Trichophyton, instead of just a cutaneous fungal infection alone. We suspected that you might have an underlying allergic response, specifically a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus. To test this hypothesis, we performed intradermal skin testing on you.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: On March 21, 2018, you underwent application of Candida, normal saline, and Trichophyton allergens on your left volar forearm. Do you recall that?\nPatient: Yes, I remember the test.\nDoctor: Based on the test results, we can better understand the cause of your symptoms and determine the most effective course of treatment. It's essential to keep an eye on your feet and report any changes or worsening of your condition.\nPatient: Okay, I will make sure to do that.\nDoctor: Great.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you've recently been diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer. Can you tell me what symptoms led you to consult your general practitioner?\nPatient: Yeah, I went to see my doctor because I was experiencing abdominal distension.\nDoctor: I understand. Your test results, including abdominal computed tomography, serum CA125 determination, and laparoscopy, revealed that you have peritoneal carcinomatosis. This led to your diagnosis of stage III ovarian cancer, according to the FIGO classification.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. Based on your diagnosis, our institutional tumor board recommended a carboplatin-paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimen in a neoadjuvant setting. We also decided that a debulking surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) would be necessary.\nPatient: Okay, so what happened next?\nDoctor: A CVL was inserted via your right jugular vein into the superior vena cava in prevision of the surgery, and the positioning of the catheter was verified by chest x-ray. You also had an implantable central venous catheter (Port-a-Cath) put in place.\nPatient: I remember that.\nDoctor: In the first 48 postoperative hours, you experienced difficult pain management, hypotension, and transient hyperlactatemia. We managed these issues with fluid replacement and norepinephrine.\nPatient: Yeah, it was a rough couple of days.\nDoctor: On postoperative day 3, you presented with acute onset dyspnea when transferred from the bed to a chair, and your pulse oxygen saturation dropped from 96% to 83%. We administered oxygen at 5 L/min via a nasal cannula to help you breathe better.\nPatient: I felt really short of breath then.\nDoctor: During your physical examination, your body temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C, blood pressure 135/81 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20/min. You didn't report any chest pain, but your pulmonary examination revealed a bilateral reduction of basal breath sounds with dullness at percussion.\nPatient: What did the chest x-ray show?\nDoctor: The chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions, which could explain your dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. We switched your oxygen delivery from a nasal cannula to a nonrebreather mask with a FiO2 of 0.40, which seemed to stabilize your condition in a supine position.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: We also took a measurement of the arteriovenous oxygen difference by sampling through your arterial and central venous line after you were in a supine position. This will help us monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.",

Based on this information, we will proceed with the heart transplant evaluation and determine the best course of action for you.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient, a candidate for heart transplant evaluation, reports a history of dyspnea and a holosystolic murmur detected at age 10, with a family history of cardiomyopathy (CM). Initial echocardiography revealed a 3.5 x 4.8 cm mass in the left atrium (LA), causing mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent tumor removal, confirmed as CM by pathology. At age 12, the patient presented with sudden abdominal and right leg pain, diagnosed with splenic infarction and femoral arterial embolism via CT, leading to splenectomy, embolectomy, and removal of multiple cardiac masses. At age 13, an asymptomatic right ventricular mass causing outflow obstruction was detected and subsequently removed.\nO: Past medical interventions include midline sternotomy for tumor removal, splenectomy, embolectomy, and multiple cardiac surgeries for mass removal, all confirming CM. Recent echocardiograms have shown recurrent cardiac masses causing structural and functional heart issues. No physical signs of Carney complex were noted.\nA: The primary diagnosis is recurrent cardiac myxoma (CM) with multiple interventions indicating aggressive or recurrent nature of the disease. Differential diagnosis could include other forms of cardiac tumors or systemic disease contributing to tumor genesis. The patient's history suggests a possible genetic predisposition to cardiac myxomas, complicating the prognosis and increasing the risk for further recurrences.\nP: Proceed with a comprehensive heart transplant evaluation to assess suitability for transplantation given the recurrent nature of CM and its impact on cardiac function. Continue regular follow-up with cardiology for echocardiographic monitoring of potential tumor recurrence. Genetic consultation may be considered to evaluate for familial syndromes associated with myxomas. Educate the patient on signs of recurrence or complications and ensure adherence to follow-up schedules."

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been feeling something strange in my mouth since September 2015. There's a mass on my gums near my maxillary right canine and first premolar.\nDoctor: I see. Let me do an examination to check it out. Hmm, I can see a 10 \u00d7 10-mm mass with elastic hardness and no mobility on the buccal gingiva at the maxillary right canine and first premolar region. There is partial redness of the surface mucosa, but it appears to be painless and non-pedunculated. \nPatient: Yes, that's exactly what I've been experiencing.\nDoctor: I'd like to take a dental radiograph to get a better understanding of the issue. After reviewing the radiograph, I don't see any clear evidence of bone resorption at the maxillary right canine and first premolar region. Based on my findings, I am making a clinical diagnosis of epulis of the gingiva.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what's the next step?\nDoctor: We'll need to remove the mass. I'm scheduling you for a resection under local anesthesia in November 2016. After the procedure, we'll have regular follow-ups to monitor your progress. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[After the surgical procedure and histopathological examination]\nDoctor: Hi again, I wanted to update you on the results of the histopathological examination. The gingival growth was well delineated with a myxomatous stroma characterized by a sparsity of fibers. There was mild infiltration of plasma cells around the periphery of the blood vessels.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means the mass was a type of oral fibroma called OFM. The myxomatous stroma tested positive for Alcian blue, which is an indicator of this condition. It was negative for PAS, and no reticular fibers were identified on silver staining.\nPatient: Will it come back?\nDoctor: It's difficult to say for certain, but no recurrence was observed at your final follow-up, 1 year after the surgical procedure. We'll continue to monitor the area to ensure your health.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.",

Can you tell me more about your past medical history?\nPatient: Oh, my past medical history was unremarkable before that.\nDoctor: I understand that you were diagnosed after presenting to a dermatologist for a febrile rash with erythematoviolaceous nodules on your hands, forearms, and trunk. What did they find during the diagnostic process?\nPatient: They did a bone marrow aspirate and found 50% infiltration by mature plasma cells. They also did a skin lesion biopsy.\nDoctor: Yes, the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome, according to the criteria proposed by Walker and Cohen's. So, you were started on PAD chemotherapy, which included bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone. Due to the immunosuppression caused by MM and the concomitant treatment with dexamethasone, you were also given colchicine (1.5 g/die) for the treatment of the Sweet's syndrome. How did your body respond to the treatment?\nPatient: The lesions disappeared after 10 days, and I continued the MM therapy.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. I see that you later underwent peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization with cyclophosphamide and received high-dose melphalan (MEL200) with PBSC transplantation in February 2008, achieving a very good partial response (VGPR). How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I was doing well for a while, but in April 2011, the cutaneous rash came back, and my MM also recurred.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It looks like you restarted colchicine and Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone to treat the recurrence. How has your body responded to the treatment this time?\nPatient: It's been working well. The Sweet's Syndrome has been the first sign of relapse in all cases, but it always reverts under colchicine and salvage treatment for MM.\nDoctor: It's good to know that the treatment has been effective in managing the Sweet's Syndrome and the MM relapses. It's important to keep a close eye on any signs of relapse and continue with the appropriate treatment. Make sure to attend regular follow-up appointments and inform your healthcare team of any changes in your symptoms.\nPatient: Yes, I understand. I'll keep monitoring my symptoms and stay in touch with my healthcare team.\nDoctor: That's great. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

And how was your anemia managed initially?\nPatient: I was diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease after a complete examination, including a BM examination, which was negative for malignancy. I was given various therapeutic agents over time to control my rheumatoid arthritis, like adalimumab, methotrexate, abatacept, infliximab, azathioprine, rituximab, and prednisone.\nDoctor: And did you undergo any surgery for your condition?\nPatient: Yes, I had a splenectomy at 67 years old.\nDoctor: How has your anemia progressed since then?\nPatient: At 68, I became transfusion dependent. Later, I was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome after another BM examination showed minimal morphologic dysplasia with a diploid karyotype.\nDoctor: What treatments have you received for your myelodysplastic syndrome?\nPatient: I was on erythropoietin support for a year, but my anemia worsened. Then, I was treated with adjusted-dose lenalidomide and my hemoglobin level reached 13 g/dL. But after 5 years, I lost the response and became transfusion dependent again.\nDoctor: Did you receive any other treatments?\nPatient: I was given one cycle of azacitidine, but it was discontinued after a BM examination showed no morphologic support for residual MDS. I continued to receive transfusions for nearly a year before coming here.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. We performed a BM core biopsy and aspiration, which demonstrated hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia, moderate reticulin fibrosis, and 2% blasts (Fig. a, b).

Can you tell me what symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling weak and I've noticed a lump in my abdomen.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We found a tumor in your liver, about 5 cm in diameter, at liver segment IV. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase. It's pressing the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with hepatocellular carcinoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that's not good.\nDoctor: I understand this is concerning. We also tested your indocyanine green retention rate, which was 21.8%, and your Child-Pugh score is A. You tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody, which is good news. However, you mentioned a history of excessive alcohol consumption, so we're considering the possibility of alcoholic liver damage.\nPatient: Yeah, I used to drink quite a lot.\nDoctor: To treat the hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed a partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and a cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of the bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated.\nPatient: What happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: On the first day following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain.\nPatient: What did you do about it?\nDoctor: We performed cholangiography via endoscopic bile duct enhancement, which showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Then we conducted drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT, which revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We decided to maintain simple drainage to reduce the cavity.\nPatient: Did that work?\nDoctor: On the 19th day after the surgery, you developed a fever and the CT revealed that the fluid collection had increased. We performed percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface.\nPatient: And then?\nDoctor: Cholangiography via the c-tube didn't show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII. Based on these findings, we diagnosed bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now?\nDoctor: We will need to implement further management to control the persistent biliary leak of 200-250 mL/day.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Have you ever had any past history of malignancy or any other significant medical events?\nPatient: No, not really. I only had a cesarean section many years ago.\nDoctor: I see. It appears that you had an endoscopic examination at a previous hospital, which revealed the presence of early carcinomas in your stomach and distal esophagus. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Based on that, you were referred to our hospital for endoscopic resection. We've conducted a thorough examination and collected some laboratory data. Your serum carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment levels were all close to normal limits.\nPatient: Oh, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: During the endoscopic examination, we found mild granular elevated lesions with slightly depressed irregular mucosa in your distal esophagus. We also noticed a superficial elevated tumor-like lesion in the lower body of your stomach, with a diameter of about 10 mm.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We performed an endoscopic biopsy on the gastric lesion, and it was diagnosed as a well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. As for the esophageal tumor, the biopsy showed intraepithelial tumor cells with atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: These histological findings suggest a malignant melanoma, invasive adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and Paget's disease as possible diagnoses. To further investigate, we performed immunohistochemical tests on the tumor cells.\nPatient: What were the results?\nDoctor: The tumor cells stained positive for CK7 and partially for CK20, but negative for S100 protein and HMB-47. All human mucin core proteins examined, such as MUC2, MUC5AC, and HIK1083, were also negative.

My vision improved after the treatment.\nDoctor: Now, in December 2014, when you were 51 years old, it appears that you were diagnosed with a VMT with an adhesion diameter of 397 \u03bcm in your right eye. At presentation, your BCVA was 1.0, and the foveal thickness was 351 \u03bcm. Can you tell me how you felt at that time?\nPatient: I was concerned about my right eye because I had already experienced the issue with my left eye.\nDoctor: After 54 days of observation, your BCVA in the right eye decreased to 0.5. It seems that you received a 0.3-ml intravitreal C3F8 gas injection in your right eye as a treatment. Do you recall that?\nPatient: Yes, I do. I had the same treatment as I did for my left eye.\nDoctor: Three weeks after the injection, the vitreous body detached from the retina in your right eye. Subsequently, your BCVA improved to 1.0 again, and the foveal thickness was 204 \u03bcm. How has your vision been since then?\nPatient: My vision has been much better since the treatment. I'm grateful for the care I received.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. It's important to continue monitoring your eye health and attending regular check-ups. If you notice any changes in your vision or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my vision and schedule regular check-ups.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and have a great day!\nPatient: You too, thanks!",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient reported initial symptoms of vision distortion in the left eye, diagnosed as vitreomacular traction (VMT) with associated macular cyst. The patient experienced similar symptoms later in the right eye. Both instances were concerning to the patient, who has a history of myopia.\nO: Initial diagnosis of VMT in the left eye showed an adhesion diameter of 397 \u03bcm and a foveal thickness of 335 \u03bcm. Post-treatment with 0.3 ml intravitreal C3F8 gas, VMT released with improved foveal thickness to 205 \u03bcm and stable BCVA. In the right eye, diagnosed with VMT (adhesion diameter 397 \u03bcm, initial foveal thickness 351 \u03bcm), post-treatment foveal thickness improved to 204 \u03bcm with restored BCVA to 1.0.\nA: The patient was successfully treated for VMT in both eyes with intravitreal C3F8 gas injections. The resolution of macular cysts and improvement in foveal thickness and BCVA post-treatment confirm effective management of VMT. No current signs of recurrence or other complications are evident.\nP: Continue regular ophthalmologic check-ups to monitor for any changes in vision or potential recurrence of VMT. Educate the patient on symptoms of potential eye health issues to ensure prompt treatment. Encourage adherence to follow-up schedules to maintain eye health and prevent complications."

I'm now going to perform a physical examination. *After examination* You have generalized abdominal pain on palpation. We'll need to do a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better understanding of what's going on.\nPatient: Okay, sounds good.\n*After CT scan*\nDoctor: The CT scan results show poor opacification of the upper and interpolar segments of your left kidney, which could be concerning for a renal infarct. To rule out an embolic source, we'll perform a transthoracic echocardiography.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\n*After echocardiography*\nDoctor: The echocardiography showed no evidence of a thrombus in your heart. To further delineate the underlying pathology and for revascularization, we'll plan a renal artery angiography.\nPatient: Okay, when will that be done?\nDoctor: We'll schedule it as soon as possible. *After angiography* The angiography showed FMD with a clot in the anterior branch of your left renal artery. We're going to start you on apixaban for the clot and amlodipine for your hypertension.\nPatient: Got it, thank you.\n*In the outpatient setting*\nDoctor: Your recent renal artery duplex showed 0-59% stenosis of the left renal artery. Carotid and abdominal visceral arterial ultrasounds were unremarkable. After one month of therapy, we'll discontinue apixaban since you're asymptomatic and your blood pressure is now 120/82 mmHg. Over the next six months, you'll undergo repeat imaging with a CT angiography (CTA) of the abdominal vasculature.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n*After six months*\nDoctor: Your recent CTA showed resolution of the clot and a beading pattern suggestive of FMD.

Our study on your son has been approved by the Ethics Committee and the Pediatric Orthopedic Clinic at Imam Khomeini Hospital. Thank you for signing the consent form. I understand you referred your son to us due to concerns about the increasing severity of his disease, despite regular occupational therapy. Is that correct?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, doctor. We've been very concerned about his condition and haven't seen much improvement with the therapy.\nDoctor: I see. In the physical examination, your son was found to be developmentally delayed, unable to walk or stand, and showed cognitional and motor retardation. We also noticed flexion contractures in his elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. There is bilateral equinovarus deformity of his feet and an increased popliteal angle. His plantar reflexes showed an extension response, and his DTRs were exaggerated. We recorded a spastic response in his muscles after continuous stretching. Also, his sitting balance is extremely unstable. Have you noticed these symptoms before?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, doctor. We've observed these issues, but we didn't know what they meant.\nDoctor: I understand. It's important to know that your son was born as a result of a consanguine marriage and had a normal pregnancy. His birth weight was 2950 grams, and his head circumference and height were 35 and 47, respectively. He showed normal weight gaining and development during the first few months of his life. He was able to hold his head at 5 months and roll over at 7 months. Do you remember when you were first told about the possibility of an abnormality?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, it was during a routine screening at 5 months of age when the pediatrician noticed a decreased head circumference growth.\nDoctor: That's correct. Further investigation showed that his head circumference reached a plateau of 40 cm around 12 months of age. Since then, his general and developmental condition seemed to experience a sudden pause with progressive delay in growth and development. He lost his ability to roll over and never gained any gross motor milestones. His face became expressionless, and his eyes started to sink into the orbits. Other findings include apparent cachectic dwarfism, microcephaly, and pigmented retinopathy. Are you familiar with these conditions?\nPatient's Mother: We've heard of some of them, but not all. It's been very overwhelming for us.\nDoctor: I understand this can be difficult for you and your family. It's essential to keep up with his occupational therapy and follow up with us regularly to monitor his progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed. We'll work together to provide the best care for your son.\nPatient's Mother: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help and guidance.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient's mother reports increasing severity of her son's condition despite regular occupational therapy. She has observed symptoms such as inability to walk or stand, and unstable sitting balance, but was unaware of their medical implications. The patient was born from a consanguineous marriage, had normal early development, but showed signs of developmental delay starting from around 5 months, with a significant decline noted after 12 months.\nO: Physical examination revealed developmental delay, inability to walk or stand, cognitional and motor retardation, flexion contractures in elbows, wrists, knees, and hips, bilateral equinovarus deformity, increased popliteal angle, extensor plantar reflexes, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), and spastic muscle response to stretching. The patient also exhibits cachectic dwarfism, microcephaly, and pigmented retinopathy. His birth weight was 2950 grams, with initial normal head circumference and height. Head circumference growth decreased noticeably by 5 months and plateaued at 40 cm by 12 months.\nA: The patient presents with severe developmental delay, motor and cognitive impairments, and physical deformities likely related to an underlying genetic or neurological condition, exacerbated by consanguinity. Differential diagnoses could include cerebral palsy, genetic syndromes, or metabolic disorders. The prognosis depends on the specific underlying diagnosis but is concerning given the progressive nature of symptoms and developmental regression.\nP: Continue regular occupational therapy and schedule frequent follow-ups in our clinic to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Genetic counseling and further diagnostic workup including genetic testing and metabolic screening are recommended to clarify the diagnosis and guide management. Educate the family about the nature of the patient's condition, potential outcomes, and the importance of regular medical care."

Can you tell me more about your history and what you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and sleepy for about two weeks. It got worse and I became so stuporous that I needed invasive mechanical ventilation.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any major surgeries or medical events recently?\nPatient: Yes, I had a Cesarean section four months ago, but there were no complications during my pregnancy or delivery.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for that information. When you were admitted to the emergency room, we performed a physical exam and found the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly, but no clinical signs suggesting cirrhosis.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We also conducted laboratory tests which registered an altered liver profile and elevated ammonia levels at 595.7 umol/L. This prompted us to perform an abdominal tomography.\nPatient: What did the tomography show?\nDoctor: The tomography reported a liver lesion that was initially interpreted as a hepatic adenoma. We then carried out abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, which showed results compatible with fibrolamellar hepatocarcinoma. There were no signs of cirrhosis or portal hypertension.\nPatient: That sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. In light of your neurological symptoms, we also performed a simple head tomography which showed unspecific periventricular lesions. A lumbar puncture ruled out infectious involvement, and telemetry reported moderate encephalopathy without seizure activity.\nPatient: So, what's causing the encephalopathy?\nDoctor: We initially thought it might be hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by urea metabolism disorders. However, tests for urinary orotic acid levels, serum amino acids, and serum citrulline levels all came back normal.\nPatient: What does that mean then?\nDoctor: Given the lack of an etiology for the hyperammonemic encephalopathy and the findings suggestive of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed a liver biopsy. The immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. There was weak expression for glutamine synthetase, while glypican 3 and amyloid A were negative. The expression for B-catenin was membrane, without aberrant expression. The cell proliferation index determined with KI 67 was 5%. This pattern favors a diagnosis of fibrolamellar variant hepatocellular carcinoma.\nPatient: Are there any other areas in my body affected by this?\nDoctor: We conducted extension studies which ruled out metastatic bone or chest involvement, and we found no neoplastic lesions elsewhere in your body.\nPatient: That's a relief. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will discuss your case with a multidisciplinary team and determine the best course of action for treatment.

Let's start with a physical examination. Hmm, everything seems unremarkable. I would suggest you get an echocardiography done.\nPatient: Alright, I got the echocardiography done, and they found an ASD with a diameter of 10 mm.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. I'd also like you to undergo an enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan to investigate further.\nPatient: Okay, I did the CT scan, and it demonstrated a huge cystic mass in my left superior anterior mediastinum, close to the pulmonary trunk.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 38-year-old woman who has been pregnant 5 times and have delivered 3 healthy children via lower segment CSs 15, 11, and 8 years ago, respectively. What brings you here today?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I'm currently 32+1 weeks pregnant, and I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing some spotting.\nDoctor: I see. Have you registered your current pregnancy with any hospital or received any antenatal care?\nPatient: No, I haven't registered with any hospital, and I haven't received any antenatal care.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms or issues during your pregnancy?\nPatient: Between 28 and 30 weeks of gestation, I had intermittent minor spotting, but I didn't go to any hospital or receive any treatment for it.\nDoctor: I understand. We've conducted some tests and found that your hemoglobin (HGB) concentration is 87 g/L. We also performed an ultrasonography, which revealed that the lower edge of the placenta is completely covering the internal cervical orifice, and there is a suspicion of the presence of a pernicious placenta previa (PPP).\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there might be a risk of severe bleeding as your pregnancy progresses. We also conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which confirmed that you have pernicious placenta previa, as well as placenta accreta and placenta percreta on the lower anterior uterine wall. We could see distended and twisted vessels on the surface of the lower anterior uterine wall.\nPatient: What will happen now?\nDoctor: You will be admitted to the obstetric ward, and we'll treat you with dexamethasone to promote pulmonary maturation in the baby. We will closely monitor your condition.\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\nDoctor: At 33 weeks gestation, you experienced 450 mL of vaginal bleeding, and we immediately transferred you to the operation room for emergency CS. Your blood pressure was 125/75 mm Hg, and your heart rate was 90 beats/min upon arrival.\nPatient: What happened next?\nDoctor: A resuscitation team, including senior staff from the departments of gynecology, obstetrics, anesthesiology, neonatology, the ICU, blood bank, laboratories, and a nursing team, was immediately established. The anesthesiologist punctured an artery for invasive blood pressure monitoring, and devices for autologous blood recovery were assembled. Nurses also established four 16 G intravenous lines for fluid infusion.\nPatient: I'm glad everything was in place. How is my baby doing?\nDoctor: The baby is doing well, and we'll continue to monitor both of you closely. It's important to follow up with your healthcare provider for any future pregnancies and receive appropriate antenatal care to minimize risks.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the care and attention I've received.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient is a 38-year-old woman, G5P3, currently 32+1 weeks pregnant, presenting with complaints of spotting. She reported intermittent minor spotting between 28 and 30 weeks of gestation but did not seek medical attention. The patient has not registered this pregnancy with a hospital nor received any antenatal care.\nO: The patient's hemoglobin level is 87 g/L (normal range: 120-160 g/L). Ultrasonography and MRI findings indicate the presence of pernicious placenta previa, placenta accreta, and placenta percreta on the lower anterior uterine wall, with distended and twisted vessels noted. At 33 weeks gestation, she experienced significant vaginal bleeding (450 mL) and underwent an emergency cesarean section. Vital signs at the time of surgery were blood pressure 125/75 mm Hg and heart rate 90 beats/min.\nA: The primary diagnosis is pernicious placenta previa complicated by placenta accreta and placenta percreta. The patient's history of multiple cesarean sections likely contributed to the development of these conditions. The significant vaginal bleeding she experienced posed a high risk to both maternal and fetal health.\nP: The patient was treated with dexamethasone to promote fetal lung maturity and underwent an emergency cesarean section due to acute bleeding. Postoperative management included close monitoring in the obstetric ward with multidisciplinary team involvement. The patient and her newborn are to be closely monitored, and she is advised to register future pregnancies early and engage in regular antenatal care to manage and mitigate potential risks. Follow-up appointments with obstetrics and possibly maternal-fetal medicine are recommended to assess recovery and plan for future care."

Can you describe the symptoms you're experiencing?\nPatient: I've had this altered mental status for 3 days, along with flu-like symptoms, a severe headache, and pancytopenia.\nDoctor: I see. Let's conduct a physical examination. Hmm, there seems to be mild neck stiffness, but the rest of the examination is unremarkable. We'll need to do some lab tests to figure out what's going on.\nPatient: Okay, doc.\nDoctor: Your laboratory tests show abnormalities, particularly pancytopenia. We'll need to perform a lumbar puncture and start you on empiric antibiotics along with acyclovir.\nPatient: Alright, if that's what you think is best.\nDoctor: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows elevated white blood cells with lymphocyte predominance, but it's negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal growth. You've shown improvement and we can discharge you with a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: *Two months later* Welcome back. Are you experiencing similar symptoms as before?\nPatient: Yes, unfortunately, the same symptoms have returned.\nDoctor: Let's repeat the lumbar puncture and analyze your CSF again. The results show elevated white blood cells with lymphocyte predominance and elevated protein. We've also tested for various infections such as Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and others, but all came back negative.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We'll need to perform further assessment and screening for HIV 1/2, hepatitis A, B, C, infectious mononucleosis, Ehrlichia, Cryptococcus, and parvovirus infection.\nPatient: Okay, please do whatever is necessary.\nDoctor: All of those tests came back negative. We'll need to perform a bone marrow biopsy due to persistent pancytopenia.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: The biopsy results are suspicious for a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. We've sent the specimen to Mayo Clinic for a second opinion. Their analysis found atypical lymphocytic infiltrate and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical analysis shows strongly positive CD20 expression, without co-expression of CD5 or CD10.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The B-cell population has a lambda light chain restriction, and the atypical lymphocytes express BCL-2 protein and cyclin D1. The results of the bone marrow biopsy indicate a rare aberrant CD5 negative MCL.\nPatient: Is it serious?\nDoctor: The clinical picture and bone marrow investigations raise concerns about primary central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We'll need to continue monitoring and evaluating your condition to determine the best course of action.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having abdominal pain and diarrhea lately.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely look into it. You're currently admitted for possible colitis. Let's discuss your recent health situation. On admission, we found that you have acute kidney injury with serum creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, while your baseline Scr was 1.2 mg/dL. Have you been taking any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, or herbal medications recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't been taking any of those. But I did take a course of clarithromycin for a respiratory infection about 2 weeks ago.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Are you currently taking any other medications?\nPatient: Yes, I'm taking methimazole for my hyperthyroidism. I've been on it for about 2.5 years now.\nDoctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Do you smoke or use any illicit drugs? Can you tell me more about your social history?\nPatient: No, I don't smoke or use any drugs, and there's nothing much to tell about my social history.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing all that. I must inform you that you have developed gross hematuria with worsening acute kidney injury. Our laboratory data shows elevated serum C-reactive protein, leukocytosis of 29.1 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, blood urea nitrogen at 50 mg/dL, increased Scr to 5.67 mg/dL, and elevated potassium at 7.2 mg/dL.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We've done some further testing. You tested positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA, 1:640), perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA, 1:320), and myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO, 109.4). However, you tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, rheumatoid factor, ribonucleoprotein antibody, double stranded (ds)-DNA antibody, Sjogren SSA and SSB antibodies, and antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody.\nPatient: What does all that mean?\nDoctor: These results help us understand your condition better. Your serum complement levels are within normal limits, which is a good sign. Your C3 is 99 mg/dL, and C4 is 34 mg/dL, both within the reference range.\nPatient: Okay, that's a relief.\nDoctor: Additionally, your serum free light chain ratio is not elevated, and serum immunofixation did not show anything concerning.\nPatient: So, what should I do now?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and develop a treatment plan based on these findings. We may need to adjust your medications and conduct further tests as necessary. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team regularly.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow up as needed.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient reports recent abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has a history of hypertension, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and hyperthyroidism secondary to multinodular goiter. He denies the use of NSAIDs, PPIs, or herbal medications but took clarithromycin for a respiratory infection two weeks ago. He has been on methimazole for his hyperthyroidism for about 2.5 years. The patient does not smoke or use illicit drugs and has no significant social history to report.\nO: On admission, the patient was noted to have acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine increase from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL to 2.8 mg/dL, which has further worsened to 5.67 mg/dL. Current labs show leukocytosis (29.1 \u00d7 10^3/\u00b5L), elevated blood urea nitrogen (50 mg/dL), and hyperkalemia (potassium 7.2 mg/dL). The patient also developed gross hematuria. Serological tests were positive for ANA (1:640), p-ANCA (1:320), and MPO (109.4) but negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C, rheumatoid factor, ribonucleoprotein antibody, ds-DNA antibody, Sjogren SSA and SSB antibodies, and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. Serum complement levels (C3 and C4) are within normal limits, and serum free light chain ratio and immunofixation are unremarkable.\nA: The patient presents with worsening acute kidney injury, likely drug-induced nephrotoxicity from recent clarithromycin use, compounded by underlying chronic conditions. The presence of ANA, p-ANCA, and MPO antibodies suggests an autoimmune component, possibly vasculitis, contributing to renal and systemic symptoms. Differential diagnoses include drug-induced nephritis and autoimmune vasculitis.\nP: The management plan will include close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes, cessation of any potential nephrotoxic agents, and adjustment of current medications as necessary. A nephrology consult is recommended for further evaluation of suspected vasculitis and guidance on immunosuppressive therapy if confirmed. The patient should maintain hydration and avoid any new medications without prior consultation. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor his condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Further testing may include renal biopsy to clarify the etiology of kidney injury and guide treatment."

It's constant and doesn't go away. \nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting?\nPatient: Yes, I've felt nauseous and have vomited a few times. My appetite has also reduced.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or any urinary tract symptoms?\nPatient: No, everything seems normal there. I even passed bowel motions without any difficulty earlier today.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any previous medical problems or allergies?\nPatient: I've been pretty healthy and have no known allergies.\nDoctor: Do you smoke or consume alcohol?\nPatient: I don't smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's check your vital signs. On admission, your pulse is 63 beats per minute with a regular rhythm, temperature is 35.9\u00b0C, blood pressure is 132/73 mmHg, and your respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute. During the examination, I noticed your abdomen is soft and non-distended with tenderness around your umbilical and suprapubic region. There's also fullness in your suprapubic region, which could be a distended bladder.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We've also conducted some blood tests. Your liver and renal function seem normal, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate above 90, and your C-reactive protein is less than 3. However, you have a low haemoglobin level of 87.0 g dl\u20131, slightly low potassium at 3.3 mmol l\u20131, a raised white cell count of 12.4 \u00d7 10\u00b9 l\u20131, a neutrophil count of 11.53 \u00d7 10\u00b9 l\u20131, and a plasma lactate of 5 mmol l\u20131.\nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Your urine dipstick also showed ketones +3 and blood +4, but no leukocytes or nitrites. These results suggest that you might be experiencing an infection or inflammation in your body.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan?\nDoctor: We'll treat you conservatively with intravenous fluids and potassium replacement, antiemetics to help with nausea, and analgesia for the pain. After receiving fluids, we'll conduct a blood gas analysis to monitor your progress. The results show a pH of 7.3, lactate of 2.12, and base excess of 2.5, which indicates that you're responding well to the treatment.\nPatient: That's good to hear. Is there anything else I need to do for my recovery?\nDoctor: Just make sure to follow up with your primary care physician and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening or new symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.",

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: Did you lose consciousness at any point during the accident?\nPatient: No, I didn't.\nDoctor: What symptoms are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I mainly have left wrist pain, and I noticed some tenderness and swelling.\nDoctor: We have taken radiographs of your wrist to assess the situation. It appears that you have a volar dislocation and rotatory deformity of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. The distal pole remains properly located, articulating with the trapezium and trapezoid. No other injuries have been identified.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: We attempted closed reduction in the emergency department, but it was not successful. Therefore, you elected to proceed with operative management. We used a dorsal approach to access the radiocarpal joint.\nPatient: What did you find during the surgery?\nDoctor: The scapholunate joint was completely disrupted, and the lunotriquetral joint was found to be unstable as well. The distal pole of the scaphoid appeared to be appropriately located without ligamentous disruption. No fractures or chondral injuries were seen.\nPatient: How did you fix it?\nDoctor: We placed three 0.045-inch K-wires into the proximal pole and used them as a joystick in concert with dorsally directed manual pressure over the distal pole to reduce the scaphoid dislocation. These wires were then advanced across the scapholunate articulation to hold the reduction. We also passed three more K-wires across the lunotriquetral joint to address the instability.\nPatient: Did you find any more issues?\nDoctor: We examined the distal pole again, but it did not demonstrate any instability. The capsule was closed with 0 VICRYL suture, and the K-wires were cut just below the skin. The subcutaneous layer was closed with buried 2\u20130 VICRYL suture, and the skin was closed with 4\u20130 NOVAFIL suture. Your wrist was then splinted.\nPatient: How did I do after the surgery?\nDoctor: You did well postoperatively, and we brought you back to the operating room eight weeks later for hardware removal. You went on to heal well and regained your wrist range of motion with occupational therapy.\nPatient: That's great to hear! How am I doing now?\nDoctor: At your most recent follow-up, five months since the injury, you have shown significant improvement. However, please continue with your occupational therapy and follow any further instructions provided by your therapist.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I will continue with my therapy and follow the instructions.",

Were you treated for any other conditions recently?\nPatient: Yes, about two weeks ago, I was treated with antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia, but there wasn't much improvement.\nDoctor: Oh, I see. Have you had any changes in your habits or exposures recently?\nPatient: Well, I started vaping about 2 months ago, and I've been using it more and more, trying new flavors too.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you used any recreational drugs in the past or currently?\nPatient: No, I haven't used any recreational drugs.\nDoctor: Alright. We performed a CT scan of your chest, which showed diffuse ground glass opacities and bilateral patchy consolidation. You also have worsening hypoxia, which required noninvasive ventilation. Your echocardiogram, however, is normal. We also conducted a bronchoscopic examination, but there were no airway lesions detected.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We further conducted a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which revealed increasing blood in four sequential aliquots, confirming the diagnosis of DAH. The BAL cell count showed more than 30,000 RBCs and 800 WBCs, with 42% neutrophils, 36% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 21% macrophages.\nPatient: What about other tests?\nDoctor: All inflammatory serologies were unremarkable, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Your serum eosinophil count, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, and anti-phospholipid antibodies were all normal. A urine toxicology screen for amphetamines, cannabinoids, and cocaine was also negative. There was no microbiologic growth on all BAL specimens.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment?\nDoctor: You were treated with pulse dose steroids after DAH was confirmed with BAL aliquots. You also underwent a right wedge resection lung biopsy, which revealed evidence of bland pulmonary hemorrhage with no evidence of capillaritis or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Prussian blue iron staining was also noted, which reflects old hemorrhage.\nPatient: Did my symptoms improve after the treatment?\nDoctor: Yes, your symptoms improved with complete resolution of alveolar hemorrhage on a chest CT scan after 2 weeks.

I have a history of SS secondary to AIH and primary sclerosing cholangitis overlap.\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe what kind of eye problems you've been having?\nPatient: Yeah, my left eye has been really painful and I've noticed some keratolysis and even a corneal perforation.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any eye issues like this in the past?\nPatient: Yes, I've had filiform keratitis and recurrent erosions for the previous 3 years. My eye disease worsened after I was in a coma in the intensive care unit due to a colon perforation and sepsis.\nDoctor: That must have been a difficult time for you. When you were admitted to the emergency department, how was the condition of your right eye?\nPatient: My right eye had deep corneal melting and my best corrected visual acuity was 0.2 decimal.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Over the past 10 months, you've had several surgical therapies performed on both your right and left eyes due to keratolysis and corneal perforations. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After the surgeries, you were prescribed postoperative therapy, including dexamethasone disodium phosphate, cyclosporine, ofloxacin eye drops, artificial tears, and human albumin. Additionally, you were given mycophenolate mofetil systemically. How has that been working for you?\nPatient: It's been helping somewhat, but I've continued to have issues with my eyes.\nDoctor: I understand. Unfortunately, enhancement of your systemic immunosuppression with corticosteroids or azathioprine was contraindicated due to your history of sepsis. However, we did perform an off-label intravitreal injection of the FAc implant in your left eye 2 weeks after the second penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) because of new signs of corneal melting. How has your left eye been since then?\nPatient: It's been better since the injection and the subsequent third PKP and amniotic membrane transplant.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. In the 6 months of follow-up after the third PKP, your left eye has shown improvement, with a closed epithelium, BCVA of 0.16, and normal intraocular pressure without medication. However, during this time, you've also had two further PKPs, one vitrectomy, and five amniotic membrane transplants in your right eye.

Can you please tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: Sure, I have type 2 diabetes mellitus and I am taking linagliptin and metformin for it. I also have untreated high blood pressure, right-sided hemiparesis from meningitis in my childhood, nephrolithiasis, and a smoking history.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Let's perform a pelvic computed tomography (CT) to get a better understanding of your condition.\n*After the CT scan*\nDoctor: The CT scan shows a 9x7.5x9 cm bulky mass in your sacrum with locally increased soft tissue density, which is causing extensive lytic lesions of the sacred vertebrae and extending to the left iliac bone. This suggests a chordoma. We will need to perform a total sacrectomy with partial excision and reconstruction of the left iliac bone to remove the mass.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What about the examination of the mass?\nDoctor: The anatomopathological examination revealed sacrococcygeal involvement by a thyroid carcinoma, as verified by immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin and TTF-1. It's predominantly the papillary (follicular variant), however, there are some foci of nondifferentiated (insular) carcinoma as well.\nPatient: What about my thyroid?\nDoctor: We performed a thyroid ultrasonography, which showed a solid nodule of 20 mm in the right lobe and two solid hypoechogenic nodules of 11 and 9 mm in the left lobe, with the smallest having coarse calcifications. No lymphadenopathies were found.\nPatient: What's next, doctor?\nDoctor: To get a better idea of the extent of the disease, we performed an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). It revealed a hypermetabolic focus in the left lobe of your thyroid, consistent with the suspected malignant neoplasia, and uptake of the radiopharmaceutical drug in the fifth lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones, indicating secondary involvement.\nPatient: That's concerning. What do we do now?\nDoctor: Consequently, we will perform a total thyroidectomy to remove the affected thyroid tissue.\n*After the thyroidectomy*\nDoctor: The histological examination of the removed thyroid tissue revealed multifocal papillary carcinoma with follicular and oxyphilic variants, but no insular carcinoma. The dimensions of the tumor foci range from 2 to 15 mm. There were no signs of hematogenic, lymphatic, or perineural permeation, invasion of the capsule, or extrathyroidal extension, and the resection margins were uninvolved by the tumor (pT1b[m]NxM1R0).\nPatient: What's the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: You will undergo radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) to target any remaining cancer cells.\n*After RAI treatment*\nDoctor: The post-therapy scintigraphy shows hyperfixation of the radioactive iodine, which indicates that the treatment is working.\nPatient: That's good news.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms and when they started?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I first started feeling chills and fever about a month ago. I went to a local hospital on November 24th, and they thought it might be acute pyelonephritis. They treated me with ceftriaxone at a dosage of 2 g daily.\nDoctor: I see. Did your symptoms improve after that treatment?\nPatient: Well, two days after admission, my back pain started. They continued the antibiotics for 18 days, and my blood cultures showed Salmonella enterica. The fever went away, and they couldn't detect any more bacteria in my follow-up cultures on the 8th and 25th days after starting treatment.\nDoctor: So, you were discharged from the local hospital on December 19th, correct?\nPatient: Yes, but I still suffered from lower back pain, nausea, and vomiting. I had to go back to the hospital just 9 days after discharge.\nDoctor: When you were re-admitted to the local hospital on December 30th, did they perform any tests?\nPatient: They did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that showed L1 spondylitis. The MRI revealed whole bone marrow oedema with endplate lytic changes in the L1 body and focal marrow oedema in the upper endplate of L2 bodies. There was also mild destruction of the intervertebral disc at L1\u20132.\nDoctor: Those findings indicate pyogenic spondylitis (Fig. a, b, c). How did they treat you for that?\nPatient: They gave me cefazolin (1 g, 3 times a day) for 10 days to cover the possibility of a Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is a common cause of pyogenic spondylitis.\nDoctor: Did they perform any more blood cultures during that time?\nPatient: Yes, they did. The cultures yielded S. enterica again. That's when they decided to transfer me here to Chosun University Hospital.\nDoctor: I understand.

Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated, tubular adenocarcinoma. According to the UICC classification, seventh edition, the tumor was at stage pT2, N0, pStage IB, and we achieved R0.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: After the surgery, you received adjuvant S-1 therapy. Three months after PD, your blood tests showed coagulation derangements, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) was quite high at 11.30 mg/dl. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 55-mm mass alongside your transverse colon. Did you feel any discomfort or pain at that time?\nPatient: Yes, I remember feeling some discomfort and pain in my abdomen.\nDoctor: During the 2-week follow-up, your coagulation derangement and elevated CRP (17.66 mg/dl) persisted. A repeat CT scan showed that the tumor had enlarged to 65 mm, and an additional mass, 25 mm in diameter, was detected in your jejunum. You were then hospitalized due to abdominal pain and diarrhea with persistent high fever. We inspected for infections, but there was no evidence of any.\nPatient: Yes, it was a rough time.\nDoctor: With the understanding that your life-threatening symptoms were secondary to the underlying malignancy, we performed extirpation of the tumors combined with partial resection of the transverse colon and the jejunum on the eighth day of hospitalization, on an emergency basis.\nPatient: I remember that surgery.\nDoctor: The histopathological findings of the two lesions showed that the tumor extended to the submucosal layer and occluded the lumen of the bowels. The lesions were identified as large and small bowel metastases from pancreatic cancer because the histopathological examination revealed morphological features similar to the primary disease. Your ascites cytology at this time was also negative for cancer.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Immediately after the emergency surgery, your fever resolved, and your CRP level normalized. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling much better, thank you.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

I'm not aware of any family history of similar issues either.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you. During your physical examination, we found a red mass in your right hip and a long strip of mass in your right groin area. There was no enlargement of your liver or spleen. We initially diagnosed you with a local infection and prescribed cephalosporin, but it seems like it didn't have any beneficial effects. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The medication didn't really help with my symptoms.\nDoctor: I see. We then conducted a subcutaneous puncture of your right buttock, and the results suggested hyperplastic lesions in the lymphoid tissue. We also found abnormal cells in your bone marrow, indicating significant lymphocyte infiltration (Fig. A). We performed a biopsy on the right groin area lymph node, and the pathology results showed abnormal hyperplastic lymphoid tissue invasion. The nucleus of these cells was irregularly shaped, the germinal center was atrophied, and the lymphoid structure was distinct from normal lymphoid tissue (Fig. B).\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a cause for concern. The immunohistochemistry results of your right buttock tumor and right groin area lymph nodes were positive for CD5 (weak positive), CD20, CD21, CD23, and Bcl-2, but negative for CD3, CD10, and cyclin D1 (Table , Fig. ). These findings suggest that both the buttock tumor and the abnormal lymph nodes are non-Hodgkin marginal zone B cell lymphomas.\nPatient: So, I have lymphoma?\nDoctor: Yes, based on the results, it appears that you have non-Hodgkin marginal zone B cell lymphoma. We also performed positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans, which showed increased non-uniform fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the subcutaneous tissue of your right buttock with an SUVmax of 11.6, an SUVmax of 9.1 in the right gluteal muscle space, and an SUVmax of 9.9 in multiple nodules on the right pelvic wall and right inguinal region (Fig. ).

At that time, your HIV RNA level was 36,500 copies/mL, with 114 CD4+ lymphocytes/\u03bcL, meeting the definition of AIDS, although the exact timing of the HIV infection was unknown. \nPatient: Oh, yes. I remember that.\nDoctor: Your records also show that you had a chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed no abnormalities, and an ophthalmologic examination showed no evidence of ocular disease. Additionally, you tested positive for anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. Since then, you have been treated with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen, including elvitegravir, cobicistat, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine, and have shown good adherence to the medications.

A CT scan was then performed, which showed the presence of an articulated accessory bone. At this point, we suspected a talus bipartitus (TB) diagnosis.\nPatient: Hmm, and what about the MRI?\nDoctor: The MRI disclosed the presence of an inflammatory process, a bone fragment covered with cartilage, and what appears to be a degenerative synchondrosis as a consequence of posteromedial impingement.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: In this scenario, a surgical procedure is indicated due to increasing symptoms and several conservative treatment trials with no response. We need to conduct a preoperative assessment, including three-dimensional CT scan images, to get full awareness of the bone fragment's specific anatomy.\nPatient: Is there anything else you need to assess?\nDoctor: Yes, we will also assess the anatomic relationship between the tibial nerve, posterior tibial artery, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorium longus, and tibialis posterior tendon and the bone fragment with the help of MRI. Although fixation of the accessory bone has been previously done, it's essential to understand the exact situation in your case.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you tell me what happened before you lost consciousness?\nPatient: Yeah, I suddenly felt really dizzy and then just blacked out.\nDoctor: You were admitted to the emergency hospital in a comatose state. We diagnosed you with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a rupture of the right vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm. To treat this, we performed an artery occlusion and ventricular drainage due to hydrocephalus. Nutrition was provided through a nasogastric tube. How are you feeling now?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm feeling much better now, thank you.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. After you gradually recovered consciousness, you required ventilation for a month. Once weaned from the ventilator, we installed a speech cannula at the tracheotomy site. Unfortunately, you developed pneumonia during that time, but we treated it with antibiotics. Now, you've been transferred here for rehabilitation.\nPatient: Yeah, I remember that. It was a tough time.\nDoctor: I understand. I see you have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no history of respiratory diseases or sleep disturbance. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. I don't smoke either.\nDoctor: Good to know. Your Epworth sleepiness scale score was 7 before the SAH. Now, let's go over your physical examination. You're 180 centimeters tall and weigh 82.6 kg. Your blood pressure is 126/81 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 19 breaths/min. Your O2 saturation is 88% on room air and improves to 97% on 1 L of oxygen per minute. \nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: Your cardiovascular examination is normal, and your lungs are clear on auscultation. Your abdominal examination is also unremarkable. On neurological examination, you're alert with a MMSE score of 28. Eye movements are normal, but there's mild narrowing of your right palpebral fissure and a constricted pupil with preserved light reflex in your right eye. \nPatient: Oh, I didn't notice that.\nDoctor: Additionally, you have mild arm and hand paresis and moderate leg paresis on the right side. Your deep tendon reflexes are brisk on the right side, and the Babinski reflex on the right side is extensor. Your right arm is ataxic, and the presence of ataxia is unequivocal in your right leg due to moderate paresis. Lastly, superficial sensation on the left side, including the face, is decreased. \nPatient: That explains the difficulties I've been having with my limbs.\nDoctor: Yes, it's important to be aware of these issues as you continue your rehabilitation. We'll work on improving your strength and sensation during your therapy sessions. It's crucial to follow your rehabilitation plan and attend all scheduled appointments to maximize your recovery.\nPatient: I understand, I'll do my best. Thank you, doctor.",

Let's start by ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to take a closer look at your brain. \n*After the MRI scan*\nDoctor: The MRI scan showed a 10 cm left frontal tumor. We need to perform a craniotomy and resection to remove the tumor and confirm its nature.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds serious. Please go ahead with the surgery.\n*After the surgery*\nDoctor: The tumor has been removed and it was confirmed as an atypical meningioma. You will need to take 400 mg of phenytoin PO once a day to prevent any seizures postoperatively.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do that.\nDoctor: Good news is that you had no seizures after the surgery. Additionally, you received 60 Gy of adjuvant radiation therapy to the postoperative bed in 30 fractions.\nPatient: Yes, everything seemed fine until three months after the resection. I developed symptoms consistent with a generalized seizure.\nDoctor: I understand. Let's resume your daily phenytoin prophylaxis with good effect.\n*Two months later*\nPatient: I've been noticing blood in my stool lately.\nDoctor: We should run an evaluation to get a proper diagnosis.\n*After the evaluation*\nDoctor: You have been diagnosed with a locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum. We will prescribe a curative-intent dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of neoadjuvant radiation therapy along with 2000 mg PO BID of concurrent radiosensitizing capecitabine.\nPatient: Okay, I'll follow the treatment plan.\n*After 20 of the planned 28 fractions*\nPatient: I started feeling unwell, and I'm experiencing new, right-sided upper and lower limb dysfunction and an unsteady gait.\nDoctor: Let's order a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain to check for any suspicious findings.\n*After the CT scan*\nDoctor: The CT scan showed no suspicious findings. However, your phenytoin level was dramatically elevated at 138 \u00b5mol/L, compared to 49 \u00b5mol/L just prior to neoadjuvant therapy. The normal range is 40-80 \u00b5mol/L. Your albumin level is also normal at 39 g/L and you're taking no other medications other than an occasional stimulant laxative.\nPatient: What should we do now?\nDoctor: We will discontinue the capecitabine and treat you with charcoal. You will be admitted for observation. We will temporarily discontinue phenytoin and then reintroduce it at the previous dose of 400 mg PO per day once levels begin to normalize.\nPatient: Alright, I hope that helps.\nDoctor: Your symptoms quickly resolved, and you showed no further complications. Keep following your treatment plan and let me know if you experience any issues in the future.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

No, I don't have any specific symptoms, but I recently had a computed tomography (CT) scan and they found something.\nDoctor: Yes, I have your report here. You have an asymptomatic 10 cm AAA, which was identified as an incidental finding on your CT scan. Do you have any history of hypertension or other medical issues?\nPatient: I do have mild hypertension, and I'm taking medication for it.\nDoctor: Okay, during the physical examination, we noticed a large pulsating mass in your abdomen, but your femoral and tibial vessels have normal pulsation. Have you experienced any intermittent claudication or pain in your legs while walking?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any complaints like that.\nDoctor: We have planned an open repair for your aneurysm. How are you feeling about this surgical procedure?\nPatient: I'm very anxious about the results and possible complications. I have a lot of stress and phobia about surgery.\nDoctor: I understand your concerns. We've consulted a psychiatrist to help you with your anxiety. To better define the aneurysm anatomy, we performed a new CT angiography (CTA) 48 hours after your admission.\nPatient: What did the new scan show?\nDoctor: The CTA revealed complete thrombosis of the AAA, just below both renal arteries, without any signs of acute renal insufficiency, mesenteric ischemia, or limb ischemia. The most impressive element was the rich collateralization between the thoracic aorta and the common femoral arteries which wasn't evident in your first CT scan.\nPatient: Oh, that's interesting. What does it mean for me?\nDoctor: During the following physical examination, we found the absence of the previous pulsating mass and absence of femoral and distal leg pulses. Your legs are warm with normal skin color. We've decided to postpone the surgical procedure and discharge you with double antiplatelet therapy and weekly follow-up for possible signs of limb ischemia.\nPatient: I see. What happened after that?\nDoctor: After a month, you presented with severe intermittent claudication in your left lower limb. We performed a digital subtraction angiogram which revealed a thrombosed abdominal aorta with collateral vessels between the aorta and both common femoral arteries.\nPatient: So, what was the next step?\nDoctor: You underwent a left axillary-femoral bypass with a polytetrafluoroethylene No. 8 graft. Your postoperative course was uneventful, and the symptom of intermittent claudication disappeared.\nPatient: That's a relief. What's the plan for my discharge?\nDoctor: We will discharge you on the fourth postoperative day with antiplatelet therapy (salicylic acid 100 mg, once daily) and a statin.

I was prescribed antibiotics for what they thought was a urinary tract infection, but my symptoms have gotten worse.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your worsening symptoms?\nPatient: Well, my dysuria has gotten worse, and now I'm experiencing pelvic pressure and abnormal vaginal bleeding for the past two days.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you had any history of abnormal vaginal bleeding before?\nPatient: No, I've always had normal menses.\nDoctor: Okay, let's proceed with an examination. I noticed the abnormal appearance of your cervix, so I'd like to refer you to gynecology oncology for further evaluation. I also see from your medical and surgical history that you had a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) in your late twenties for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2/3, ESSURE placement, and chronic tobacco use. Can you tell me more about your follow-up care after the LEEP?\nPatient: I haven't been very consistent with my follow-ups. I remember having a normal pap smear years ago, though.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. Have you been sexually active recently?\nPatient: Yes, I've had a new male partner for the last four months. I've never had any sexually transmitted infections, including HSV.\nDoctor: I appreciate that information. Upon examination, I didn't find any lesions or abnormalities in your external genitalia. However, the speculum exam revealed bloody vaginal discharge and a 4-cm firm, circumferential cervical mass with possible left parametrial involvement. I'm going to obtain a biopsy of the cervical mass for further evaluation.\nPatient: What did the biopsy results show?\nDoctor: The tissue pathology came back negative for malignancy, but it did show acute inflammation and cellular changes suggestive of HSV infection. Your Pap smear results were unremarkable and tested negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We need to do more tests to have a better understanding of your condition. I'd like to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for you.\nPatient: What did the MRI scan show?\nDoctor: The MRI scan revealed an elevated T-2 signal concerning for potential neoplasm at the outer surface of the cervix, which encircled the cervical os. There were also mildly prominent right inguinal lymph nodes noted.\nPatient: What's the next step?\nDoctor: Due to the ongoing concern for possible cervical malignancy, I'd like to take you to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment. We will discuss your options once we have more information.\nPatient: I understand. Thank you for your help, doctor.",

What brings you to the emergency room today?\nPatient: Hi Doctor, I've been having increasing fatigue, shortness of breath, and coffee ground stool lately. It's getting pretty concerning.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. We'll need to perform an emergency esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy to investigate these symptoms further. We found an ulcer during the procedure, so we'll manage it conservatively with Protonix and stop your aspirin for now.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for taking care of me. \n*Two months later*\nDoctor: Welcome back! How have you been feeling since your last visit?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better, but still not 100%.\nDoctor: Alright, let's proceed with a follow-up esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy to check on your progress. We found a single 25 mm submucosal nodule at the gastroesophageal junction 40 cm from the incisor, and it appears to extend 2 cm up into the esophagus (Fig. ). There was no Barrett esophagus or mucosal disease identified. We took a biopsy and found that it's adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a form of cancer, but we'll move forward with an endoscopic mucosal resection to remove the tumor. After the resection, we'll continue to monitor your progress.\nPatient: I'm relieved that there's a treatment plan. \n*Seven months later*\nDoctor: Good news! You have been disease-free for seven months since your resection. The biopsy showed proliferation of haphazard and angulated glands with focal crowding accompanied by desmoplastic stroma underlying squamous-columnar junctional mucosa. The endoscopic mucosal resection demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma invaded into the submucosa.\nPatient: I'm glad the resection was successful. What did the tumor look like?\nDoctor: The tumor had various levels of differentiation, from poorly-differentiated areas with solid tumor growth and small glands to well-differentiated areas with cystically dilated glands and attenuated epithelial lining. Eosinophilic secretion with focal crystallization was present in the lumina of the majority of the glands.\nPatient: Oh, interesting.\nDoctor: Yes, and despite the various differentiation, the tumor cells had similar cytomorphology with abundant cytoplasm, eosinophilic coarse granules, and centrally located nuclei. The texture of the cytoplasmic granules was similar to the luminal secretion, indicating active secretion.\nPatient: I see. I'm just grateful that the resection worked and that I'm doing better now.\nDoctor: Absolutely, and we'll continue to monitor your progress to ensure your ongoing health.",

How have you been feeling since your admission?\nPatient: Well, I've been yawning a lot, like more than 3 times per minute. Sometimes I even have these episodes where I yawn more than 8 times in a row. It's not because I'm tired or bored.\nDoctor: Hmm, interesting. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the yawning?\nPatient: Yes, I've had nausea and vomiting too.\nDoctor: I see. We performed a cranial MRI, which showed moderate leukoaraiosis but no signs of inflammation. There was also a signal enhancement of the coregistered myelon up to the lower medulla. We then conducted a cervical MRI, which revealed the full extent of the cervical myelitis over more than three vertebral segments. \nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: It's definitely something we need to address. We also examined your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and found a slight pleocytosis with lymphocytes (7 cells), but no elevation of CSF protein. The CSF-restricted oligoclonal IgG bands were present as well. Your visual evoked potentials were normal on both sides.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, you meet the diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). We found a positive test for AQP4-IgG and acute myelitis. There's no evidence for alternative diagnoses like other systemic autoimmune, infective, vascular, neoplastic, or paraneoplastic diseases.\nPatient: I should mention that I have a history of autoimmune hepatitis with increased ANA titer, but it's been inactive under long-term treatment with azathioprine.\nDoctor: That's important to know. We started treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone, followed by plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption. Your clinical symptoms of ataxia and hypesthesia, as well as the spinal cord enhancement on MRI, have shown regression within 10 days.\nPatient: Well, that's good news.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. Consequently, the frequency of your yawning normalized, and no more episodes of excessive yawning were observed. We'll be initiating treatment with rituximab to further address your condition.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

We need to know what to do next.\nDoctor: Alright, let's take a look at her. During the clinical examination, I can see that the stents are in her bilateral nares, and there seems to be partial absence of the nasal septum. Do you have any previous CT images for her?\nParent: Yes, here they are.\nDoctor: Thank you. After reviewing these CT images, I can see that the pyriform aperture is narrowed, measuring 5.4 mm. There is also mild medial angulation of the nasal processes of the maxilla, and I noticed a single central mega-incisor. The CT scan of the brain shows no intracranial abnormalities, which is good news.\nParent: Oh, that's a relief.\nDoctor: Now, before we proceed with further surgical management, we need to check the patency of her airway after stent removal. We will perform a CT scan immediately after the stents are removed.\nParent: Okay, let's do that.\n(After the CT scan)\nDoctor: Alright, I have reviewed the CT scan after the stent removal. The pyriform aperture measurement is now 10.3 mm, which is considered satisfactory. The central mega-incisor is still present, but the nasal septum is almost completely eroded.\nParent: Oh no, what caused that?\nDoctor: It's probably due to compression erosion by the stents. On posterior rhinoscopy, there is no significant stenosis at the posterior choanae, which is a good sign.\nParent: So, what's next for her?\nDoctor: After the removal of the stents, we observed her for cyanosis, and it's good to see that there were no complications.

Did the antibiotic therapy help improve your symptoms?\nPatient: No, not really. I still felt pretty bad and eventually needed supplemental oxygen.\nDoctor: We conducted a CT scan of your chest, and it showed innumerable cystic lesions with diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs and a lesion in the liver. To further investigate, we did an extensive workup for lung and liver disease, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infection tests, human immunodeficiency virus testing, hepatitis panel, expanded connective tissue disease workup, and comprehensive interstitial lung disease markers. \nPatient: Oh, wow. What did you find out from all those tests?\nDoctor: The cancer markers revealed an elevated cancer antigen 19-9. An abdominal ultrasound showed innumerable cystic lesions throughout your liver, with most of them appearing simple. It also showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We performed a liver biopsy, which suggested a benign simple cyst wall and acute inflammation of hepatocytes. These findings raised a differential diagnosis, including bile duct obstruction, mass effect, adjacent abscess, or adverse drug/toxin effect. \nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: Due to the unusual findings on the CT scan and the failure of the liver biopsy to provide a clear diagnosis, we decided to perform a lung biopsy. We obtained lung tissue by videoscopic-assisted fluoroscopic surgery to your right chest with wedge resection.\nPatient: And what did the lung biopsy show?\nDoctor: The pathological examination showed metastatic, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, middle lobe, and lower lobe of your lungs.\nPatient: That sounds serious. What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that you have a type of lung cancer that has spread to other parts of your lungs.

CT imaging showed a rounded, soft tissue density lesion in the same location. MRI scan indicated a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense lesion with post-contrast enhancement. Histopathological analysis post-excision identified the mass as a well-demarcated lesion composed of fascicles of spindle cells with thick vessels and verrucae bodies, areas of infarction, and S100 positive on immunohistochemistry.\nA: The primary diagnosis is a benign neural lesion, specifically a schwannoma, based on imaging and histopathological findings. The lesion is non-cancerous with a good prognostic outlook.\nP: The patient underwent surgical excision of the chest wall mass under general anesthesia, followed by hospital admission for monitoring. Post-operative recovery is expected to be straightforward given the benign nature of the schwannoma. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor recovery and ensure no recurrence. Patient education regarding the nature of the schwannoma and symptoms of recurrence will be provided."

Can you describe the pain you've been feeling?\nPatient: Yes, it's been bothering me for a while now. I don't have any fever and the pain isn't there when I'm resting.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on the Roentgenography findings, there is some slight narrowing at L1/2, but overall, it looks relatively normal (Fig.). Do you have any known drug allergies?\nPatient: No, I don't have any drug allergies.\nDoctor: That's good to know. For now, we'll administer some analgesics to help with the pain, and we'll keep you under observation.\n[One month later]\nPatient: Doctor, my back pain has worsened since my last visit. I also have a temperature now, it's 37.2 \u00b0C.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me check if there are any neurological abnormalities in your lower limbs. It seems like there are none. We've also conducted some laboratory tests, and I'd like to share the results with you. Your C-reactive protein is 11.5 mg/dL, which is quite elevated compared to the reference value of less than 0.2 mg/dL. Your white blood cell count is 7970/mm3, with neutrophils at 87.7%. The reference range for white blood cell count is 4000\u20138000/mm3. Your aspartate aminotransferase is 15 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase is 13 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase is 291 IU/L, and creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL. The reference ranges are 13\u201333 IU/L, 6\u201330 IU/L, 115\u2013359 IU/L, and 0.4\u20130.7 mg/dL, respectively.\nPatient: Hmm, I see. What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: We also took some Radiographs of your lumbar spine, and it showed a collapse of L1 and an absorbable change in the caudal side of L1 (Fig.). We then did a lumbar MRI, which confirmed the presence of fluid at the L1/2 disc, edema and destruction of the spinal body of L1/2, and lumbar canal stenosis at the level of L1/2 on fat-saturated T2-weighted images (Fig.).\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we've diagnosed you with pyogenic spondylitis of the lumbar spine. We performed a biopsy of the L1/2 disc and identified Parvimonas micra \u2013 a gram-positive anaerobic bacterial species found in the oral cavity \u2013 in the biopsy specimens.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the treatment plan?\nDoctor: Given that you're able to tolerate oral medications, and the transfer rate of metronidazole to the blood is similar between oral and intravenous administration, we'll prescribe metronidazole to treat the infection. We'll closely monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment as needed.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

I understand your wife received prenatal care during her pregnancy, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, she did.\nDoctor: At 12 weeks, a Doppler ultrasound examination revealed increased resistance in her uterine arteries, so salicylic acid was prescribed. From the 23rd week, several Doppler scans showed intrauterine growth retardation with persistent notching in the right uterine artery and increased resistance in the left. No scan revealed any malformation, though.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Your baby was born by vaginal delivery using Thierry\u2019s spatula due to an abnormal foetal heart rate. His Apgar scores were 4, 7, and 8 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. His arterial cord blood pH was 7.22, and his cord lactate was 5.1 mmol/L. \nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: His birth weight was 2045 grams, length was 51 cm, and head circumference was 32 cm. The placenta was hypotrophic with peripheral insertion of the cord and signs of maternal vascular hypoperfusion. There was no lesion of decidual arteriopathy at the pathological examination.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Shortly after birth, your baby experienced respiratory distress, including suprasternal tugging and stridor. He was bagged with air for a few minutes and then supported with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).\nPatient: Yes, it was scary.\nDoctor: Prolonged apnoea associated with bradycardia required caffeine from the first postnatal day. His initial exams showed normal brain US and normal serum electrolytes with calcium.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: On day 2, a flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) was performed and revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the adducted position, causing severe airway obstruction. This prompted a transfer to a medical and surgical neonatal intensive care unit on day 3.\nPatient: Oh, I remember that day.\nDoctor: Upon admission, the clinical examination revealed a wide anterior fontanel, enlarged coronal sutures, and normal temperature. We will continue to closely monitor your baby's progress and provide the necessary care.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate all the efforts to help our baby.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient's father reports that the prenatal period was complicated by findings of increased resistance in uterine arteries and intrauterine growth retardation. The baby was delivered vaginally with assistance due to abnormal fetal heart rate, and experienced respiratory distress shortly after birth. The father recalls the use of Thierry\u2019s spatula during delivery and subsequent interventions including nasal CPAP and caffeine administration due to prolonged apnoea and bradycardia.\nO: At birth, the baby's Apgar scores were 4, 7, and 8 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. Arterial cord blood pH was 7.22, and cord lactate was 5.1 mmol/L. Birth weight was 2045 grams, length 51 cm, and head circumference 32 cm. Initial postnatal exams showed normal brain ultrasound and serum electrolytes with calcium levels. On day 2, FFL revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Clinical examination upon NICU admission noted a wide anterior fontanel and enlarged coronal sutures.\nA: The primary diagnosis is bilateral vocal cord paralysis leading to severe airway obstruction, likely contributing to the observed respiratory distress and apnoea. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of neonatal respiratory distress such as infection or neurological disorders, though these seem less likely given the clinical findings and history. The prognosis depends on the management of the airway obstruction and monitoring for potential complications from the underlying condition and interventions.\nP: The management plan includes continued respiratory support as needed, monitoring in a neonatal intensive care setting, and further evaluation by a pediatric otolaryngologist. Caffeine therapy will continue to manage apnoea. Regular follow-up exams will assess growth, development, and any emerging complications. Education for the parents regarding the baby\u2019s condition, care requirements, and signs of potential complications is essential for ensuring compliance and early detection of issues. Referral to specialized care for the management of bilateral vocal cord paralysis and its implications is also planned."

I also have a dull ache in my left eye, but no other symptoms.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Let's do a physical examination to see if we can find any clues about what's causing this. \n(After the examination)\nDoctor: Based on the examination, the only pertinent finding is left temporal hemianopia. I would like to get an MRI of your orbits with contrast to get a better understanding of what's going on.\nPatient: Okay, sure.\n(After the MRI results are available)\nDoctor: The MRI revealed a large mass lesion in the mid- and posterior thirds of your optic nerve pathway. The typical \"tram-track\" appearance of sheath enhancement around the central optic nerve that we would expect for an optic nerve meningioma is absent. Rather, the lesion essentially replaced the optic nerve and appears to demonstrate infiltration into the nerve, raising suspicion for an optic nerve glioma. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the mass is atypical and not showing the usual findings we would expect for this type of lesion. Our tumor board discussed your case and decided to proceed with a 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan to gather more information, especially to rule out an optic nerve glioma.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\n(After the PET/CT scan results are available)\nDoctor: The 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan showed an asymmetric fusiform enlargement of your left optic nerve with associated conspicuous diffuse radiotracer uptake and a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 10.8. Portions of the lesion showed increased attenuation on non-contrast CT, suggesting calcification. There was also a nearby but separate focus of activity more superoposteriorly, localizing to the left aspect of the planum sphenoidale.\nPatient: So, what does all that mean for me?\nDoctor: These findings present a complex situation, and we need to further discuss your case with our multidisciplinary team.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I understand you were referred to our hospital because of a cystic lesion in your liver that was demonstrated by abdominal ultrasonography (US). How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: I've been feeling okay, just a bit worried about this lesion.\nDoctor: I can understand your concern. We've conducted several laboratory studies, including liver function tests and tumor markers, which are all within normal limits. And serological markers for hepatitis B or C viral infection were undetectable.\nPatient: That's a relief! So, what did you find in the imaging tests?\nDoctor: Well, the abdominal US revealed a well-demarcated, heterogeneously low-echoic mass that's 170 mm in diameter in the right lobe of your liver. We also performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography (CTHA), which showed early ring enhancement in the peripheral area in the arterial phase and slight internal heterogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase.\nPatient: Hmm, and what about the MRI?\nDoctor: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tumor had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and some foci of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl (Gd-EOB) MRI revealed no uptake in the corresponding area.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean?\nDoctor: We also did an abdominal angiography and it demonstrated a large avascular region in the liver corresponding to the tumor, although no typical features of cavernous hemangioma were evident. An 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no abnormal FDG uptake. With these radiological findings, we couldn't exclude the possibility of a malignant liver tumor, such as biliary cystadenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, mesenchymal tumors, or hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cystic formation.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds concerning. What's the next step?\nDoctor: Given the findings, we decided that the patient should undergo a posterior sectionectomy. During the intraoperative examination, we found a relatively soft dark red tumor. The resected specimen weighed 1.1 kg and measured as 170\u00d7100\u00d780 mm.\nPatient: And what did you find in the tumor?\nDoctor: The cut surface of the tumor revealed a white, solid, and cystic mass that was elastic, soft, and homogeneous with a yellowish area considered to be myxoid degeneration. Histological examination showed that the tumor mostly consisted of a sclerotic area, and a cavernous hemangioma area was partly observed.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The sclerotic area presents diffuse fibrosis, and the typical histology of cavernous hemangioma was confirmed in some parts. In addition, a marked increase and dilation of medium-sized veins with cavernous form were frequently noted.\nPatient: So, is the tumor malignant or not?\nDoctor: Based on the histological examination, it appears to be a cavernous hemangioma, which is a benign tumor. However, we'll continue to monitor your condition and follow up with you as needed.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything to me. I feel much better now knowing it's not malignant.",

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having upper abdominal pain for a while now. I also experienced night sweats without fever for the past 12 months, and I've had some exertional dyspnea.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or been diagnosed with any pre-existing disorders like neurofibromatosis?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any weight loss, and I've never been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis or any other disorders.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. We conducted a CT-scan, which showed a lesion that was about 9.1 x 6.6 cm in size in your right-sided paramedian retroperitoneal area. This lesion appears to be displacing your inferior vena cava and stretching your right renal vein. We also performed a [18 F]FDG-PET/CT, which confirmed the presence of the lesion, and it showed a malignoma-typical increase of metabolic activity in the marginal areas. However, no hematogenic or lymphogenic metastases were identified.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We wanted to rule out pheochromocytoma, so we tested for catecholamines and metanephrines in your 24-hour urine collector, and the results were negative.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So what's next?\nDoctor: We performed a CT-guided puncture to obtain punch cylinders from the lesion. Some of the samples showed hyalinized and cell-poor spindle cell proliferation, while others had siderite pigmentation. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were strongly positive for S-100 and showed nuclear positivity for SOX-10. They were negative for MDM2, Desmin, CD1a, Melan-A, HMB-45, and smooth muscle actin (SMA). The MIB-1 proliferation index was less than 1%. Molecular-biologic analysis did not reveal any MDM2 amplification.\nPatient: So, what does all of this mean?\nDoctor: Based on our overall histopathologic assessment, you have been diagnosed with a benign schwannoma with marked regressive changes. This means that the lesion is not cancerous, which is good news. However, the displacement of your inferior vena cava and right renal vein, as well as the malignoma-typical metabolic activity, should be monitored closely.\nPatient: Oh, I'm relieved that it's benign. What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We'll discuss the best course of action for your specific case and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. Depending on the location and size of the schwannoma, we may consider treatment options like surgery or radiation therapy.

We performed a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, which showed residual gallstones in the gallbladder fossa and/or cystic duct remnant. There were also multiple small fluid collections and forming granulomatous masses surrounding additional retained or dropped gallstones in the surgical tracts and vicinity.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, the CT scan revealed a fistula with gallstones extending through the posterior and inferior wall of the second portion of your duodenum, to the anterior and superior aspect of a right renal cyst, which measured 3.4 cm x 3.0 cm and contained gas in its superior aspect.\nPatient: Is that something to be worried about?\nDoctor: We compared this with a previous CT of your abdomen and pelvis performed with IV contrast sixty-five days prior to admission and seven days prior to the LC. That scan demonstrated a simple right renal cyst in the location of the now complex and infected cyst, measuring 2.8 cm x 2.5 cm.\nPatient: So it's gotten worse since then?\nDoctor: Yes, it appears that the renal cyst has become infected. We considered draining the infected renal cyst seen on the initial CT, but it was relatively small and inaccessible. We will need to monitor your condition closely and decide on appropriate treatment based on how the infection progresses.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We will keep a close eye on your condition and discuss further treatment options as needed. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.",

Can you tell me more about what happened?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a skin biopsy on my right leg about 2 weeks ago for a possible skin cancer. Thankfully, the pathology came back negative, so no cancer. I didn't have any complications after the biopsy.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. What have you been doing since the biopsy?\nPatient: Well, about a week after the biopsy, I went on a planned vacation with my family to the Bahamas. We had a great time, swimming in the resort's chlorinated pools and even did this adventure activity where we swam with wild pigs in the ocean.\nDoctor: That sounds like a fun trip. Did you notice any changes in your leg while you were there?\nPatient: Actually, the night before we were supposed to leave, I developed pain and redness at the site of the skin biopsy. The pain got worse overnight, and I noticed significant edema and worsening discoloration of my leg. I couldn't even walk the next morning because of the pain.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Were you experiencing any other symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I was feeling pretty terrible. I had malaise, and I felt feverish and had chills.\nDoctor: It seems that when you arrived at the emergency department, your temperature was 39.1 degrees Celsius, your blood pressure was 109/55 mmHg, and your pulse was 140 bpm. Your physical exam showed a circular wound on your right anterior shin with marked erythema, warmth, and induration surrounding it, and it was very tender to palpation. You also had significant 2+ pitting edema up to your knee, and the erythema extended in streaks onto your thigh and into your right groin, with enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. \nPatient: Yeah, it's been really painful and uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I can imagine. Let's talk about your past medical history. I see that you have a history of coronary artery disease, a coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve and graft, and atrial fibrillation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I'm on warfarin for anticoagulation and a beta blocker. I used to smoke, but I quit over 40 years ago.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Your medical history and current symptoms will help us determine the appropriate course of action. We'll do our best to address your pain and swelling and find out what's causing it. Make sure to follow up with your primary care doctor and let them know about this visit.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for your help, Doctor. I really appreciate it.",

Can you tell me a bit about yourself and where you live?\nPatient: Hi, I'm a 21-year-old male Caucasian student, and I live with my parents in a rural area of the country.\nDoctor: Alright, can you tell me what symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: For the past 6 months, I've been feeling fatigue and weakness with exertion. I also have palpitations and blurred vision.\nDoctor: I see. Prior to these 6 months, were you completely asymptomatic?\nPatient: Yes, I didn't have any of these symptoms before.\nDoctor: We conducted a physical examination and some tests. Your high sensitive troponin T and N-terminal -pro-brain natriuretic peptide results were normal. Your 24-hour electrocardiogram showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and biphasic T waves.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also performed a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which revealed a multivesicular, septated cystic formation with a thin outer wall in your left ventricle (LV). The largest daughter cyst measured 6.5 \u00d7 6 cm and protruded into the LV cavity (Fig. a). All the other daughter cysts protruded into the right ventricle (RV) (Fig. a). There was mild inflow obstruction of the RV. We did not observe any connections between the cysts and blood flow on continuous-wave Doppler and color-flow mapping.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We did further workup with CMR, which confirmed the TTE findings. The total lesion size was 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 \u00d7 6 cm. Residual myocardium was present only in the apical segments of the IVS, while none was observed in the affected area (Fig. b). Thoracic and abdominal imaging revealed multiple hepatic cysts as well.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: Serologic confirmation of echinoccocal infection was performed with Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on the imaging characteristics, the cystic pathology is described as a type 2 active lesion.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: There are some technical challenges from a surgical perspective, including total removal of the cyst without disseminating its contents and potentially complex reconstruction of the IVS. Consequently, we will initiate medical therapy with albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg.\nPatient: Okay, what about the palpitations and other symptoms?\nDoctor: We will also administer Bisoprolol and amiodarone to help manage those symptoms. We will closely monitor your condition and adjust the treatment as needed.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

You were admitted 1 hour after the event, and your no-flow and low-flow times were 1 minute and 17 minutes, respectively.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. I didn't realize it was that bad.\nDoctor: Yes, it was a serious situation. You were initially unconscious and without sedation. We mechanically ventilated your lungs, placed a pleural drain, and monitored your pulse oximetry, which was 100% on FiO2 0.5. Your arterial pressure was 160/70 mmHg, and your heart rate was 110 bpm.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also gave you norepinephrine at an infusion rate of 1mg/h to manage your blood pressure. Your temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, and your glycaemia was 8 mmol/L. Thankfully, there were no signs of pneumothorax at that time.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, and we actively treated your fever without inducing hypothermia. However, you were still unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3/15 and conserved bilateral photomotor reflexes.\nPatient: What about the intermittent movements I was having?\nDoctor: You experienced intermittent bilateral ocular revulsion and bilateral shoulder tremor. We administered Propofol with a bolus followed by a continuous infusion, which stopped the eye and shoulder movements immediately.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: One hour later, a 13-channel EEG diagnosed a NCSE pattern of generalized periodic spike-waves evolving in generalized rhythmic spike-waves at 1 Hz with high amplitude (> 200 \u00b5V) without a response to stimulation. We then gave you Midazolam, which resulted in a burst suppression pattern.\nPatient: So, what happened next?\nDoctor: On day 2, we added Clobazam and levetiracetam to ensure a smooth transition between IV and oral antiepileptic drugs. Conventional EEG recording showed a pattern of burst suppression, and raw EEG from the BIS monitor showed an isoelectric signal.\nPatient: That sounds like things were getting better?\nDoctor: Yes, they were. On day 3, we replaced the 4-channel sensor with a 2-channel sensor connected to your bedside monitoring. We then gradually decreased both Propofol and Midazolam.\nPatient: I'm glad things improved.

Can you describe the pain and its frequency?\nPatient: Yeah, the pain comes and goes, but it's mostly in my abdomen around the belly button. It's been like this since my adolescence.\nDoctor: I see. You were admitted to our hospital in May 2018. Were there any specific tests or exams conducted at that time?\nPatient: Yes, there were some tests. They found that I had iron deficiency anemia and positive results for stool occult blood test, but no bleeding in gastroscopy and colonoscopy.\nDoctor: Alright. On examination, we noticed lower limb edema and mild abdominal tenderness around the umbilicus. Your vital signs were within normal range though. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: I've had an appendectomy, oophorocystectomy, and a caesarean section. I've never taken NSAIDs.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Our laboratory examination confirmed iron deficiency anemia with a hemoglobin level of 86 g/L and hypoalbuminemia level of 14.7 g/L. Your C-reaction protein was elevated at 30.95 mg/L. The fecal occult blood test was positive as well. Other test results, like renal and liver functions, autoimmune antibodies, and T-spot, were within normal range. Do you remember the results of your colonoscopy and gastroscopy?\nPatient: Yes, they showed normal results, but the abdominal CT scan found segmentally thickened small intestinal walls.\nDoctor: That's correct. Due to the presence of a metal intrauterine device, magnetic resonance (MR) enterography was prohibited. Instead, we used capsule endoscopy (CE) for further inspection. It revealed multiple circular ulcerations and stenoses. We also performed double balloon endoscopy (DBE) for the retained capsule, which showed multiple ulcerative stenoses. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the retained capsule.\nPatient: What did the biopsy report say?\nDoctor: The biopsy report suggested nonspecific moderate chronic inflammation, and the villi became widened and shortened. The culture of bacteria or acid-fast stain for tuberculosis were negative.\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis?\nDoctor: Based on the results, you have been temporarily diagnosed with CMUSE. We've started you on a treatment plan that includes methylprednisolone (40 mg/day) and parenteral nutrition to help manage your symptoms and improve your condition.\nPatient: Okay, I hope this treatment works.

Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had this pain and swelling in my right scrotum for about 10 days now. It's been getting worse, and for the past two days, I've noticed some bad-smelling drainage coming from it.\nDoctor: I understand. Do you have any history of diabetes, hypertension, or any other co-morbid diseases? \nPatient: No, I don't have any of those.\nDoctor: That's good to know. And do you have any risk factors like drug-use, immunodeficiency, genito-urinary or anorectal trauma, and infection in your medical history?\nPatient: No, I don't have any of those issues either.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your physical examination, we detected massive edema in both hemiscrotum and a black necrotizing area with malodorous pus drainage in the bottom of your right hemiscrotum. Your anorectal examination was normal. We also performed some laboratory analysis on you. Your serum creatinin was 0.9 mg/dl, hemoglobin 14.9 g/dl, glucose 486 mg/dL, CRP 156 mg/L, WBC 14.5x106 cells/mL, and sodium 132 mmol/L.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also did a scrotal ultrasound, and there was no infection sign in your bilateral testis, but their sizes were found smaller (right testis 25x20 mm, left testis 20x20 mm). To address your high glucose levels, we started intravenous crystallized insulin therapy. We've also started you on intravenous imipenem 4x500 mg and Clindamycin 4x600 mg prophylactically, as per the infectious disease consultation.\nPatient: I see. What about the treatment for the necrotizing tissues?\nDoctor: We performed a right hemiscrotectomy, and during the operation, your right testis had a normal blood supply appearance. After the surgery, we did an open wound dressing with nitrofurazone and rifamycin for the first three days.\nPatient: And what about after that?\nDoctor: From the postoperative 3rd day to the 15th day, we used the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) technique on your wound. This technique keeps the wound environment under sterile condition and decreases the frequency of changing protective covers of the wound.\nPatient: How does that work?\nDoctor: The VAC dressing creates mechanical stress with negative pressure from the vacuum system. This helps the wound edges diminish, accelerates granulation formation, and increases cellular proliferation and neoangiogenesis.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.",

Did you have any history of smoking?\nPatient: No, doctor, I've never smoked.\nDoctor: Alright. It seems that you were admitted to a local hospital before coming here, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest revealed a mass in your left lung. They diagnosed you with lung cancer and obstructive pneumonia. Did you receive any antibacterial treatment?\nPatient: Yes, I did. But my condition didn't improve after the treatment.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During our examination, we observed an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node on your right side. We also conducted some tests, and the results show that your serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), CA153, and CA19-9 levels are elevated to 94.5, 37.2, and 49.9 U/mL, respectively. Your blood test for HIV was negative, and your CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts were 744 and 576 cells/\u03bcL, respectively.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: The plasma galactomannan test result was positive, and your C-reactive protein level was 7.68 mg/L. However, tests like the serum cryptococcal antigen agglutination test, acid-fast bacillus test of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid smear, and blood and sputum cultures for fungus and bacteria were all negative.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that we need to continue investigating your symptoms, as we haven't identified a clear cause yet. Your serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM were normal, and other routine laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, blood sugar, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, antinuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-ds-DNA antibodies, and cardiolipin-antibodies were all normal as well.\nPatient: Alright. So, what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: Since the mass identified by CT in your left lower lung hasn't been fully investigated, we will need to conduct more tests and possibly a biopsy to determine the nature of the mass. This will help us provide a more accurate diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you.\nPatient: Okay, doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness.

The patient denies any history of smoking but has worked in a humid environment. Previously diagnosed with lung cancer and obstructive pneumonia at a local hospital, the patient did not improve after antibacterial treatment.\nO: Physical examination revealed an enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node. CT scan showed a mass in the left lung. Laboratory tests indicated elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) at 94.5 U/mL, CA153 at 37.2 U/mL, and CA19-9 at 49.9 U/mL. HIV test was negative; CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts were 744 and 576 cells/\u03bcL, respectively. Plasma galactomannan test was positive; C-reactive protein was 7.68 mg/L. Tests for serum cryptococcal antigen, acid-fast bacillus, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid smear, and cultures for fungus and bacteria were negative. Routine lab tests including complete blood count, liver enzymes, and renal function were normal.\nA: The primary diagnosis remains lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia, complicated by an unidentified infectious or inflammatory process indicated by elevated tumor markers and a positive galactomannan test. Differential diagnoses could include fungal infection or other malignancies. The prognosis depends on further characterization of the lung mass and underlying conditions.\nP: Plan to conduct additional diagnostic tests including a biopsy of the lung mass to better understand its nature and to refine the treatment approach. Continue monitoring symptoms and report any changes. Provide patient with instructions for preparing for upcoming tests and ensure follow-up appointments are scheduled.

Can you tell me about any history of antepartum low-back pain, trauma, drug use, or any physical exertion?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any significant history of low-back pain, trauma, drug use, or physical exertion during my pregnancy.\nDoctor: Alright. During your examination, you were conscious, well oriented, and afebrile. The neurological examination showed complete paraplegia, which means power 0/5 with decreased tone, associated bowel bladder involvement, and absent deep tendon reflexes at knee and ankle joint with complete sensory deficit below the level of L1. We conducted necessary blood investigations, including coagulation profile, and everything came out normal.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step?\nDoctor: We planned for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your dorsolumbar spine with screening of the whole spine. The MRI revealed an extradural broad-based ellipsoid lesion, measuring 50 \u00d7 9 mm along T12 to L2 vertebra, displacing the dura anteriorly. It showed T1 hyperintensity, T2 hypointensity with minimal postcontrast enhancement, suggesting an early subacute bleed causing mass effect on the adjacent cord with areas of altered signal intensity at the level of lesion.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on the clinical evaluation and the MRI report, we decided to plan an urgent decompression in the emergency operation theater. After preoperative marking of D12\u2013L2 vertebral levels under fluoroscopic guidance, we exposed the midline and elevated the paraspinal muscles up to the medial edge of the transverse processes on both sides with the help of Cobb's and a broad osteotome.\nPatient: What happened during the surgery?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, we performed a bilateral complete laminectomy of the L1 vertebrae and removed the ligamentum flavum. We found a well-defined firm organized hematoma, dark reddish-black in color, measuring 5 \u00d7 1 cm over the dura. We removed the hematoma and checked for adequate decompression using an infant feeding tube. The sample we removed was sent for histopathological examination, which reported it as an organized hematoma.\nPatient: How did I recover after the surgery?\nDoctor: Postoperatively, you recovered rapidly in terms of neurological deficit. You were discharged on the 10th postoperative day with almost complete neurological recovery and improved bladder bowel incontinence.\nPatient: That's great to hear. So, what should I do now?\nDoctor: At the time of discharge, we will provide you with instructions on how to maintain your recovery and any follow-up requirements. It's essential to follow these recommendations to ensure a smooth and complete recovery. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us.",

How were you feeling during that time?\nPatient: I was feeling pretty stable and my mental state was alright. My PANSS score was 95/210 and I tested negative for all the illicit substances.\nDoctor: I see that your mental state suddenly deteriorated four weeks later. What symptoms did you experience during that time?\nPatient: I became very aggressive, both physically and verbally, and I had severe features of sexual disinhibition. I also started having delusional thoughts and complex grandiose and persecutory delusions.\nDoctor: It seems like you also believed you were part of a secret army and being chased by the Albanian mafia. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I thought I had powers to kill people with my thoughts and that I had to fight for my life against the mafia.\nDoctor: I understand that you became aggressive with staff members, and on four occasions, the emergency team was called to provide extra sedation. Your PANSS score increased to 115/210, and your UDS tested positive for both SCRAs and THC. The clinical team decided to add Haloperidol 10 mg daily and Clonazepam 8 mg daily to your treatment plan.

Can you tell me more about these symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain for about 2 months now. It started as sciatica, and it's been really bothering me.\nDoctor: I understand. It appears that you underwent radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine at another hospital. The results showed a vertebral tumor in your lumbar spine. Do you remember anything about the sensory exam they performed?\nPatient: Hmm, I think they said it was normal.\nDoctor: That's correct. Your patellar tendon and Achilles tendon reflexes were normal. However, it was noted that your left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscle were manual muscle testing (MMT) grade 3, while the other muscles were MMT grade 5. \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: The laboratory blood tests revealed hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-reactive protein. You also had a resection of retroperitoneal DDL 5 years ago, and then a repeated resection for recurrence 3 years ago. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: It seems that there was another recurrence 1 year ago, and spinal metastasis of WDL component occurred in your L2 vertebrae 8 months ago. The tumor gradually increased in size, as seen in computed tomography (CT) scans.\nPatient: Yeah, I remember that.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, no additional treatment was done at that time. The MRI showed a mass with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, and no enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. Based on the revised Tokuhashi score and the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINP), we diagnosed the vertebral tumor as metastasis of WDL component in DDL.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Given your situation, we've planned surgery for symptomatic improvement. The procedure will involve tumor curettage and L1 laminectomy, followed by percutaneous pedicle screw fixation from Th11 to L3 using intraoperative 3-D CT computer navigation.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds like a good plan.\nDoctor: The histological examination of the primary lesion showed mixed well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Lipoblasts containing hyperchromatic nuclei were apparent in the well-differentiated area.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor is a mix of well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which is a type of cancer. The presence of lipoblasts with hyperchromatic nuclei indicates that the cancer is indeed active and growing.\nPatient: I understand. What should I do after the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and follow up with any additional treatments or care as needed. It's important to attend all scheduled appointments and follow the instructions provided by your healthcare team.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do my best to follow all the instructions.

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I see here that you're a 37-year-old man who has presented to the thoracic surgery department with a persistent consolidative lesion in the right lower lobe. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Well, I'm a 14-pack-year smoker, but I don't have any history of recent trauma or significant disease.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a chest computed tomography scan and found a 2 cm focal consolidative lesion with bronchiectasis in the subpleural region of the lateral basal segment of your right lower lobe. Have you been experiencing any issues with breathing?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having some trouble.\nDoctor: I see. Our records show that you've been under observation for approximately four months in the outpatient pulmonology department. During this time, the size of the lesion has slightly increased, as seen in this figure (shows Fig).\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We didn't find any lymphadenopathy or other mass lesions, which is good news. To address the issue, you underwent a single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: During the surgery, we performed a wedge resection of the lesion. It showed an ill-defined fungating mass with focal cystic change, measuring 7.5 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm and weighing 410 g. We have some gross and microscopic features of the lesion here (shows Figure).\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\nDoctor: The findings from the surgery were consistent with the characteristics of PTL. You had an uneventful clinical course and were discharged without any complications.\nPatient: That's a relief. What should I do now?\nDoctor: It's important to follow up with your pulmonologist and thoracic surgeon for regular check-ups to ensure there's no recurrence of the lesion. Additionally, I strongly recommend quitting smoking to improve your overall lung health.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I'll follow your advice and make an appointment for a follow-up soon.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. Take care.",

I'm feeling fine, actually. No issues at all.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Your mammogram demonstrated a new density in your left breast, which is why we've asked you to come in. Have you experienced any symptoms or discomfort in the area?\nPatient: No, not at all. I didn't even know there was an issue until you called me back.\nDoctor: I see, so you were asymptomatic. That's not uncommon with breast densities. How about your overall health? Are you generally fit and active?\nPatient: Yes, I am. I exercise regularly and have no major health problems.\nDoctor: Great. And what about your family history, are there any instances of breast cancer or other related conditions?\nPatient: No, not that I'm aware of. My family has been pretty healthy overall.\nDoctor: That's reassuring to know. Now, I'd like to perform a bilateral breast examination to check for any abnormalities. Is that okay with you?\nPatient: Sure, go ahead, Doctor.\nDoctor: (After the examination) Alright, the examination appears to be normal. However, due to the new density found in the mammogram, we will need to perform additional tests to ensure it's nothing to be concerned about.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. What kind of tests will you be doing?\nDoctor: We will likely perform a diagnostic mammogram and possibly a breast ultrasound or biopsy, depending on the results. These tests will help us determine the nature of the density and whether further treatment is necessary.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining that. When should I schedule these tests?\nDoctor: You can schedule them as soon as possible. Our receptionist can help you with that on your way out.

The pre-hospital care emergency medical personnel diagnosed you with ventricular tachycardia and administered a 150 mg intravenous bolus of amiodarone. They then transported you here for further evaluation. \nPatient: Yeah, that's right.\nDoctor: Despite the ventricular tachycardia at a rate of about 210 bpm, you appear to be hemodynamically stable. Your labs were unremarkable, and your troponin test came back negative. Your chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary vascular congestive changes. \nPatient: Oh, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: After administering additional antiarrhythmic therapy, you converted to ventricular bigeminy. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% with regional wall motion abnormalities in a coronary distribution localized to the left ventricle. The left ventricular structural measurements suggested an abnormal LV mass index and severe concentric hypertrophy. Your systolic and diastolic functions were also abnormal, with reduced ejection fraction and diastolic filling pressures.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, we took it seriously and performed cardiac catheterization. It revealed only mild luminal irregularities in the left anterior descending and circumflex systems, along with a 50% lesion of the mid-right coronary artery. Given the mild atherosclerotic disease noted on your coronary angiography, the overall impression was that of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\nPatient: What does that mean for me, doc?\nDoctor: We decided to place an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help manage your condition. You were discharged but later discontinued amiodarone due to vague muscle aches. \nPatient: Yeah, those muscle aches were bothering me.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, you returned two weeks later after several defibrillator discharges, in congestive heart failure, with persistent ventricular bigeminy. We believe that your worsened heart failure was due to the bigeminy.\nPatient: So, what do we do now?\nDoctor: We'll treat your condition with diuretics and control the ectopy to help manage your heart failure. It's important to closely monitor your symptoms and keep regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for your help, doctor.",
    "soap_note": "S: The patient, a middle-aged male, presented to the emergency department with progressive lightheadedness, palpitations, and weakness.

Can you tell me what brought you in?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this epigastric pain for like 9 months now. It's been getting worse and I've been vomiting a lot, even sometimes with blood. I've also lost a lot of weight, around 4 kg in the last 4 months.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any urinary symptoms or changes in bowel habits?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: Okay, do you have any past medical history or previous surgeries that I should be aware of?\nPatient: Well, I did have a habit of eating hair years ago, but that's it. No surgeries or anything.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for that information. Now let me just check your vitals. Your temperature is 36.8 \u00b0C, pulse rate is 125 beats per minute, breathing rate is 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure is 119/65 mmHg. I'm also going to examine your abdomen. \nDoctor: I noticed there's tenderness and a hard mass over your epigastric area, extending towards the right hypochondrial area. Your bowel sounds are also sluggish. We ran some tests, including a CBC, LFT, and RFT, and the results were within normal limits. However, a CT scan of your abdomen was done at another hospital and it showed some concerning findings. \nPatient: What did the CT scan show?\nDoctor: Your stomach was grossly distended and compressed, with displacement of the transverse colon. The colon was filled with intra-luminal abnormal mass-like contents, and there was a mottled air pattern extending to fill the pylorus and first part of the duodenum. These findings suggest a possible trichobezoar, which is a mass formed from ingested hair.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We attempted endoscopic removal of the hair, but unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. We've prepared you for surgery to remove the mass.\nPatient: What will the surgery involve?\nDoctor: We'll perform an upper midline incision and use electrocautery to deepen it. After entering the abdominal cavity, we'll find the distended stomach with firm content. We'll then perform a vertical gastrostomy, which is an incision in the stomach, about 10-14 cm in length. \nDoctor: Inside your stomach, we'll find a large amount of ingested hair, which has been occupying most of the stomach. We'll remove the hairball and then perform suction and irrigation to clean the area.\nPatient: And how will the stomach be closed?\nDoctor: We'll insert a negative suction tube and adjust its position intra-operatively. The stomach will be closed in two layers in a continuous manner. The first layer will be closed with full-thickness using 3-0 PDS, and the other layer with another suture material.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll take good care of you during the surgery, and we'll discuss any further treatment or follow-up requirements afterward. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hi there, I understand you recently had a physical examination and a solid mass was found in your right kidney via ultrasonography. Have you been experiencing any backache, abdominal pain, urinary irritation, hematuria, or dysuria?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Do you have any history of tuberous sclerosis?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Okay. During your physical examination, there was no eminence or tenderness in the costovertebral angle, hypochondriac point, or ureteral point, and your laboratory examination didn't show any abnormality. We did a computed tomography (CT) scan and it revealed a well-defined solid tissue mass in your right kidney, which suggests renal cell carcinoma (Fig. A).\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: I understand it's concerning. The next step was to perform a radical right nephrectomy, which you received without any radiochemotherapy. After the nephrectomy, we found that the tumor had a volume of 7.5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 cm3, with a solid and soft texture and a colorful appearance due to necrosis and hemorrhage.\nPatient: Wow, that's quite large.\nDoctor: Yes, it was. Histochemical staining showed that the tumor contained a large portion of necrotic tissue and atypical epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic or granular cytoplasm (Fig. B). These cells were scattered within the tumor or organized closely in nests separated by glassy collagen fibrils (Fig. A). The tumor cells possessed more than 1 round-to-oval atypical nuclei, with irregularly distributed coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli (Fig. C).\nPatient: What does all that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor cells had an abnormal appearance, which is not typical for normal cells. The mitotic count was about 2 in 50, under high power field (HPF; Fig. D). Regretfully, we found that the tumor cells were infiltrating into the surrounding renal parenchyma.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We conducted immunohistochemical staining. The tumor cells tested positive for MelanA (Fig. F), were focally positive for HMB-45 (Fig. E) and vimentin, and 10% positive for Ki67. Tests for the following were negative: SOX-10, S-100, RCC, CD10, PAX8, PAX2, SMA, desmin, and cal.\nPatient: What do those test results mean for me?\nDoctor: The results help us determine the type of tumor and its aggressiveness. The positive markers indicate that the tumor is malignant, but the negative markers for RCC and other proteins suggest that it could be a rare type of renal cell carcinoma. We'll need to closely monitor your condition and do follow-up tests to ensure there's no recurrence.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll be here to support you throughout this process. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.",

Let's do a physical examination first. Your age-adjusted BMI is at the eleventh percentile, which is a bit concerning. Your abdominal examination shows a soft, nontender abdomen and normoactive bowel sounds. We'll need to run some laboratory tests to get a better understanding of your condition.\nPatient: Okay, doc.\nDoctor: The lab analysis results are in. Your leukocyte count is 8.1 bil/L, hemoglobin is 11.4 g/dL, and platelets are 207 bil/L. Your alkaline phosphatase is 125 U/L, but other parameters of liver function and renal function are within normal limits.\nPatient: Hmm, what does that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate that there might be an issue with your digestive system. We'll need to perform a colonoscopy with terminal ileal intubation to get a clearer picture.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\nDoctor: The colonoscopy revealed severely erythematous and granular mucosa with focal exudation from the rectum to the ascending colon. These findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, your cecum and terminal ileum appear endoscopically normal.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: We also did histopathologic analysis of colonic biopsies, which revealed chronic colitis with a moderate neutrophilic and lymphocytic mucosal infiltrate, crypt distortion, and scattered crypt abscesses. The cecum and terminal ileum appeared histologically normal.\nPatient: What's the treatment plan?\nDoctor: We'll start you on infliximab 5 mg/kg, which should provide initial symptomatic relief. Unfortunately, you re-presented a year later with recurrent bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive, despite compliance with infliximab therapy.\nPatient: Yeah, it's been tough.\nDoctor: It seems you developed infliximab antibodies, so we escalated the infliximab dose and added extended-release budesonide 9 mg/day and azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day, after determining that your TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) activity was within normal limits. However, your symptoms progressed despite therapeutic infliximab levels.\nPatient: What's the next step?\nDoctor: You underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RPC and IPAA) for refractory UC, which successfully controlled your symptoms for a while. But you re-presented one year postoperatively with abdominal pain, 10 loose and bloody bowel movements per day, and involuntary 5 kg weight loss.\nPatient: Yes, I'm really struggling again.\nDoctor: We found elevated fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin levels. We also tested your stool for ova and parasites, bacterial cultures, and Clostridium difficile toxin A and B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nPatient: What were the results?\nDoctor: The results were unrevealing, so we'll need to explore other options to manage your symptoms and address the underlying issue. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and work together to find the best course of treatment for you.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, we've recently examined you and found a slightly heterogeneous tumor. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit off, but I didn't think it was that serious.\nDoctor: We performed an en bloc tumor resection to remove the tumor and conducted a histopathological examination. It revealed a WHO grade II glial tumor with exclusively oligodendrocytic differentiation. Are you familiar with what that means?\nPatient: No, not really. Can you explain it to me?\nDoctor: Of course. A glial tumor is a type of brain tumor, and the grade II means it's relatively slow-growing. Oligodendrocytic differentiation means that the tumor cells resemble oligodendrocytes, which are a type of brain cell.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So, what's next?\nDoctor: We also did a molecular analysis, which showed an IDH1 mutation but no 1p19q codeletion. Despite the intact 1p19q chromosomes, we diagnosed the tumor as an oligodendroglioma based on its characteristic oligodendroglial phenotype throughout the entire resection.\nPatient: Hmm, I see. What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: We'll monitor your condition closely and determine the best course of action based on how your body responds. We selected a total of 23 ROIs (regions of interest) in your case, including 14 in hot spot regions, five in areas with medium uptake, and four in areas with lower uptake in the tumor periphery.\nPatient: Wow, that's a lot. How does that help?\nDoctor: By analyzing these regions, we found a significant correlation between MET uptake and tumor cell count, proliferation count, and vessel count. In simpler terms, this helps us understand the tumor's behavior and growth patterns, which can inform our treatment decisions.\nPatient: I see. So, what's the prognosis?\nDoctor: There was no significant correlation found between tumor perfusion and histological cell markers, which means your prognosis is not clear-cut. However, we'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\nPatient: Okay. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll do our best to support you through this process.",

    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, I've been reviewing your computed tomography (CT) imaging results, and it looks like we incidentally discovered bilateral renal masses. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?\nPatient: No, I haven't felt anything unusual.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Based on the imaging, we performed a robotic assisted partial nephrectomy on the right renal lesion. The results show a 4-centimeter Furman Grade 2, pT1a clear cell RCC with negative surgical margins. For the 2-centimeter mass on the left kidney, due to its posterior location, you opted for percutaneous cryoablation. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling okay, no major issues.\nDoctor: Great. We followed up with cross-sectional imaging over a 2-year period and found no evidence of cancer recurrence in either kidney. However, after 2 years following the therapy, we did notice a new contrast-enhancing lesion in the perinephric fat of the left kidney.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: To further examine the area, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They demonstrated a 2-centimeter enhancing and restricting ill-defined soft tissue focus in the left kidney region where the previous cryoablation was performed. We decided to forego a biopsy due to the rapid development, consistency, and location of the lesion.\nPatient: So what was the next step?\nDoctor: You underwent an open subcostal partial nephrectomy with complete perinephric fat removal. Surgical pathology revealed that the resected renal mass contained organized tumefactive fat necrosis with a multinucleate GC reaction, but no evidence of clear cell RCC recurrence.\nPatient: That's a relief. What did the immunohistochemistry studies show?\nDoctor: The studies showed an inflammatory reaction characterized by abundant histiocytes and multinucleate giant cells that were positive for CD68 (KP1). Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and PAX-8 immunohistochemistry were both negative.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me moving forward?\nDoctor: It's good news. You are now 2 years removed from the surgery and there is no sign of cancer or disease recurrence. We will continue to monitor your condition closely, but you should be able to carry on with your regular activities.\nPatient: That's great to hear, thank you for your help.",

The left renal mass, 2 cm in size, was treated with percutaneous cryoablation. Follow-up cross-sectional imaging over 2 years showed no cancer recurrence. Recent MRI scans identified a new 2 cm enhancing lesion in the perinephric fat of the left kidney, post-cryoablation. Subsequent open subcostal partial nephrectomy pathology indicated organized tumefactive fat necrosis with a multinucleate giant cell (GC) reaction, no clear cell RCC recurrence. Immunohistochemistry showed inflammatory reaction with histiocytes and multinucleate giant cells positive for CD68, negative for Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and PAX-8.\nA: The primary diagnosis is organized tumefactive fat necrosis post-cryoablation with no evidence of clear cell RCC recurrence. Differential diagnosis initially included potential RCC recurrence, which was ruled out by surgical pathology and immunohistochemistry.\nP: The patient will continue regular monitoring for any signs of recurrence or new lesions.

What's your baseline BMI?\nPatient: My baseline BMI is 47.8 kg/m2, and I've had multiple unsuccessful attempts at weight loss.\nDoctor: How about your HIV status? Are you on any medications for that?\nPatient: Yes, my preoperative HIV status is well controlled, with a CD4 count of 440 cells/\u03bcL and an undetectable viral load. I'm taking Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir), darunavir, and ritonavir.\nDoctor: Alright. For your type 2 diabetes, have you tried any treatments to control it?\nPatient: Yes, I've tried various treatments like glucose transporter inhibitors, insulin sensitizers, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and high-dose basal insulin. But my HbA1c remains elevated at 128 mmol/mol.\nDoctor: After discussing with the medical team, we decided that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the risks even though your glycemic levels are not optimized. How has your type 2 diabetes status been since the surgery?\nPatient: My HbA1c dropped to 90 mmol/mol 2 years after the surgery, and my fasting glucose is now 12 mmol/L.\nDoctor: It's important to note that diabetes remission was not achieved in your case due to the duration of your diabetes and preoperative insulin requirements. However, you now have a reduced pill burden and a markedly reduced daily insulin requirement, down to 38 units from 140 units preoperatively. \nPatient: Yes, that's true.

Can you tell me if there's any history of toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus infections in your family?\nPatient: No, there's no history of those infections, drug ingestion, consanguineous marriage, or genetic diseases in my family. My partner is healthy, but there is a familial trend of being small for gestational age (SGA) at birth.\nDoctor: I see. It's important to note that a cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks of gestation due to FGR and nonreassuring fetal status. You gave birth to a female infant weighing 1,498 g (-3.4 SD) with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. \nPatient: Yes, I remember that. The newborn required some oxygen, like 0.25\u20130.5 L/min, soon after birth.\nDoctor: That's correct. A chest X-ray examination was conducted 1 day after birth which revealed left CDH. Sac-type CDH was suspected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 21 days after birth. Radical operation for CDH was performed at 30 days after birth, and the diagnosis of left sac-type CDH was confirmed. No associated abnormalities were detected.\nPatient: Yeah, I'm glad the operation went well. But her postoperative course and subsequent development had some issues with insufficient postnatal catch-up growth.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage in the first trimester. You were referred to our hospital at 30 weeks of gestation for appropriate management of FGR, 5 years after your first parturition. Obstetric sonography showed polyhydramnios and a simple, smooth cystic lesion in the left dorsal thorax, with the fetal heart displaced to the right side. No associated malformations were detected.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What did that mean for the fetus?\nDoctor: These findings suggested that the fetus had sac-type CDH. MRI revealed that the stomach and spleen were herniated into the sac-type CDH of the left chest. The right lung-head ratio was 1.64, suggesting severe pulmonary hypoplasia after birth.\nPatient: So, what was the plan for the delivery?\nDoctor: An elective cesarean section was performed at 38 weeks of gestation under general anesthesia. You gave birth to a male infant.",

Can you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I haven't really noticed any specific symptoms, but the chest roentgenogram found something.\nDoctor: Yes, it appears that your chest computed tomography (CT) showed a mediastinal tumor in your right thoracic outlet, adjacent to your right subclavian vein and right brachiocephalic artery (Fig. a, b). A preoperative diagnosis is unavailable, but it's suspected to be a benign neurinoma with a possibility of malignancy. We will be starting the operation with VATS, in preparation for TMA.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What does that mean for me during the surgery?\nDoctor: During the surgery, you'll be placed in a left semi-lateral decubitus position. We'll place three access ports at the 5th intercostal space on the middle axillary line, the 3rd intercostal space on the middle axillary line, and the 5th intercostal space on the anterior axillary line.\nPatient: Hmm, I see. And what happens after that?\nDoctor: We'll begin with dissection of the caudal side using VATS (Fig. c). However, due to the low mobility of the tumor, poor visualization, difficulty in handling surgical devices and the tumor location, safe dissection of the cranial side might be difficult and risky.\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What will you do if that happens?\nDoctor: If we encounter those difficulties, we will switch to TMA. TMA allows for better visualization of the cervical vessels and nerves, which will enable us to safely dissect the cranial side and completely resect the tumor (Fig. d). \nPatient: So, what will the intraoperative diagnosis be?\nDoctor: The intraoperative diagnosis will be a benign tumor compatible with a neurogenic tumor. After the surgery, there's a chance you may experience Horner syndrome transiently, but it should resolve naturally.\nPatient: That's a relief. How long will I need to stay in the hospital after the surgery?\nDoctor: You'll be discharged 6 days postoperatively. The final diagnosis will be schwannoma, and the tumor will be completely resected.\nPatient: That's good to know. And what about my recovery after those 6 days?\nDoctor: Three months after the operation, you should be free of Horner syndrome and any functional restriction of your right upper extremity. We'll monitor your recovery closely and ensure you get the best care possible.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your explanation and your help with this.",
